T,"what I need for you to do right now is, every one of you get out a blank sheet of paper.",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"ashley, can I have a piece of paper?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,just put it right on the table back there.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,thank you.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,thank you Sarah.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"don't leave without it, all right.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,listen closely now. everybody ready?,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,yep.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,can someone raise their hand and tell me what's one obvious thing that I can do to graph? nick?,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,the slope.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,use the slope with the?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,y intercept and X intercept.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"y intercept. that's probably the way you'll probably want to do it, right Nick?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,yeah.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"is there another way, though? Robert?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"use the, um, tables.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"right, to make a table for the equation, right? and then plot the points from the table. so go ahead and get started.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"Nick, question?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"where's this...oh, right here?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,yeah. you're going to graph on that. that is your result for your group.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"so everybody has to do one graph, right?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,right.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"so while he's doing that, let's get started on this, guys. what are we going to do?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,do we write this on our piece of paper?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,yeah.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"oh, okay.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,all right?,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"Mister Ormsby, you know, when you put, like, a one in here, would you go like, times plus...",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"ah, see, so now you've already forgotten, right? first of all, zeros are our favorite number, right?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,yeah.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,you put in zero. two thirds times zero is what?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,zero.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,plus eight is?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,eight.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,eight.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"now because this fraction is a two thirds, do you remember what I told you what numbers you should pick now?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"um, threes.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"all right. so maybe zero, three and six would be good numbers to try with this one, right? that way you don't have to worry about fractions and mixed numbers.",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,all right.,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"Mister, I forgot how to do these again. Like how do you do X and Y?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"okay, so now wait a minute. you want to make a table then, right? the idea again is, to make our points we just pick any number we want for x. We can do that, right? Jenna?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"yeah. so it was zero, one, and two",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"ah, that's true, except because this is a two thirds fraction +...",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,you want to pick three as like +/.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,exactly.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"negative three, zero and three.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"right, and if you want to just do zero, three, six and stay away from negatives, you can do that too.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,all right?,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"I got six in the middle. so, zero, three, six.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,right.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,and you think you can do it on your own now?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,you just want to be on the camera.,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"no, that's not true.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"okay, we're going to put in zero here, right?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,what's two thirds times zero?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,zero.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"everybody watching, right? plus eight is?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,eight.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,eight.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,so three times two is...,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,six.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,divided by three is two.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,three is two.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,plus eight is...,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,eight is?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,ten. okay I get it. thank you Mister Ormsby.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay. good job.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"all right, so, okay, this is what I did. I put three negative three, zero, three and six, all right?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,how come you have your table backwards? I've never done that before.,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"well, I did that.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,it's easier this way.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"all right, if you say so.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"anyways, I put negative three, so, I put two thirds and then that.",T,TIMSS-Math_1
T,times negative three.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"yeah. negative three goes in the top, right?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"right. well, negative three, you remember, is negative three over one.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,there you go.,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"so it's a one and a one. but that's a negative still, right?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,right. that's still a negative there.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,so it's negative two?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,plus eight is?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,six.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,yeah.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"see, I knew that.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"so negative three is six, zero is eight. now, try a positive three.",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"cause they're both positive so... two third so, three, one and...oh.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"one one, and then three, eight, eleven.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"no, wait a minute.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,two... one is... and five.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"two plus... wait a minute, no, you were timesing it.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,oh. it's ten.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,it's ten.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,and then six is twelve.,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,it's six then ten and twelve.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,all right.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,yes?,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"all right, I just totally forgot um, you know, how to do the graph.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"okay, now what I liked how you at least remember to use multiples.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"like this one, let's try this one right here. All right?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"you remembered to use fives, but let's try zero. if I put in zero there, what's three fifths times zero?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,um... zero?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,right. minus ten?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,is negative ten?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,so put a negative ten there.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"so now you're going to try five in there, right?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,so just write a little five there so you can mentally see it. so if I do three times five that's?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,fifteen.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"now remember I'm going to divide by the five, which gives me?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,three.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,minus ten.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,negative seven.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,good job.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,I think you got it now.,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"oh, okay.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,all right.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,finish it up.,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,Mister Ormsby?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,all right.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"uh, how many points do you want us to plot? three or four?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"well that's a very good question. obviously, how many points do I really need to make a line?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,two.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,two.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,right? but just to make sure...,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,three.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,plot at least three points.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,that way if they're all in a line you know you did it right.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay?,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,Mister Ormsby.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,yeah?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,I made the graph.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"use the whole paper, man.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay?,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,don't we have to graph every single one of those?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"yeah, you're going to graph these five. that's why I want you to use the whole paper. make a big coordinate system.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,oh.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"as a matter of fact, let me give you a fresh one to save you some time.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,"oh, okay. all right, now I get it.",F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"use the whole coordinate system, that way all the lines are nicely spaced out and everything.",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,all right.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay?,T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,we're out of space.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"okay, well how do you want to graph it? using an x y table?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,yeah.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,or do you want to learn how to use slope and y intercept?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,x and y table.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,okay.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"see, if you work with Chris side by side, then you can compare answers. right?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,mm hm.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,don't just rely on Chris here.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"The idea is I'm gonna plug in any values I really want for x and figure out my corresponding y. But because this fraction is a two thirds, what numbers should I possibly use that would make it easier for me?",T,TIMSS-Math_1
S,three.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,"numbers based on three. or zero, three, six, would be good enough, right?",F,TIMSS-Math_1
S,yeah.,F,TIMSS-Math_1
T,that way you can get that graph down. okay?,F,TIMSS-Math_1
