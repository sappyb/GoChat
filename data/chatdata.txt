teacher_FUNGI : Good morning guys, we’re going to start
student_FUNGI : It's too cold. Yeah it was cold outside.
teacher_FUNGI : um, so let me show you the fungi unit, and so I have one warm-up question for you and its “where have you seen fungi?” jot down a couple of ideas. Ok, so where’s places where you might have seen fungi?
student_FUNGI : In my backyard
teacher_FUNGI : Great, in your backyard where though?
student_FUNGI : Um, towards the mossy area, it’s hard to explain.
teacher_FUNGI : Towards like the corner, or is it on…
student_FUNGI : A bunch of mushrooms
teacher_FUNGI : Oh, a bunch of mushrooms, in the hay.
student_FUNGI : Something weird on its ..., its like a disease, that’s what the doctors say.
teacher_FUNGI : Oh, what’d it look like?
student_FUNGI : It was weird looking ...
teacher_FUNGI : Oh ok, so you didn’t get to see what it looked like but you know it was growing on its foot?
student_FUNGI : Like mushrooms on the trees in the woods.
teacher_FUNGI : Ok, so in the natural environment?
student_FUNGI : Those weird things that stick out of the sides of trees.
teacher_FUNGI : Ok, so on trees.
student_FUNGI : Um, on decrepit logs
teacher_FUNGI : What do you mean (?)
student_FUNGI : Like just rotted, like, like falling apart ... the fungi ...
teacher_FUNGI : Ok, any other places? Yeah, Diana?
student_FUNGI : In the grass in my front yard.
teacher_FUNGI : In the back of your car?
student_FUNGI : No, no. In the grass in my front yard.
teacher_FUNGI : Oh, the grass, ok great.
teacher_FUNGI : So we’ve seen fungi, um, sometime in our life, uh, whether it’s on food or in nature like on trees or whatnot, we’re gonna be looking at more examples today too, so we have activity 42 for you. So I want you to show me that’s one of the things as you’re going around, um, oh actually as it- as you’re working at your lab station. And at your lab station what you’ll find are some colored pictures of different types of fungi, so there are twelve different types that you can look through. Um, a good idea is to have all the pictures spread out at your lab station so you can look at all of them together. And there are different bins with different types of things in them. So for instance, this station here has um, some fruit, that has uh, fungi growing on them. So you’ll make some observations uh about some of the things you see here. Remember we’re practicing our observations like we did at the beginning of the day. So uh, what kinds of things can you observe when you’re looking at these?
student_FUNGI : Uh, that they’re really old and not healthy.
teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, so you’re making observations like that, some visual observations that maybe make- it also you can maybe make some guesses about what you think is happening inside some of these things too. So this station here has, um, fruit with mold on it. Um, I’ve got another station with mushrooms on it. Um, another one with petri dishes with mushrooms on them. And I think, um, some fungi growing as well. So, you can take a look- oh and bread, bread growing, uh, mold growing on bread. So when you’re uh, when you’re looking at the different bins here you’re looking at some of the different type of fungi um, and when you’re done, um, I’m going to give every group maybe about six or seven minutes. I’d like the team managers up at the front to kinda keep an eye on the clock, so at about every six or seven minutes I’d like you to take your bin and pass it to the next station, we’ll go in this order.
student_FUNGI : oh, oh, I can smell the pepper
teacher_FUNGI : Which part are you working on?
student_FUNGI : We’re working on ...
teacher_FUNGI : Ok, so you have a good list here, where are you getting this list from?
student_FUNGI : From the ...
teacher_FUNGI : Ah, so your journal is a helpful tool, huh? Ok, so can you maybe describe what you guys know, some examples (?), like they, they made food, what do you mean by that, oh they make food, so you’re saying that-
student_FUNGI : No we need food, we need, in our ...
teacher_FUNGI : Oh they need food, so they don’t make their your own. How do you know? Do you know that for sure?
student_FUNGI : No, it’s something they do. Photosynthesis.
teacher_FUNGI : What are some examples? How do you know they make their own food? What are you basing it off of?
student_FUNGI : Because, well they, normally they always have something- they’re always arguing, they always pretend they’re not growing out of the ground ...
teacher_FUNGI : Ok, so they- yeah, what’d you say?
student_FUNGI : It needs a host so it becomes a host.
teacher_FUNGI : Um, so, how is it getting the nutrients from it? We know that plants make their own food. We eat food, we eat it with our mouth, how are they eating their food?
student_FUNGI : I don’t know, they eat bacteria. It decomposes.
teacher_FUNGI : What do you mean by that?
student_FUNGI : Like, like, like it disappears after a while and the bacteria’s just left.
teacher_FUNGI : Oh, ok, so that’s like when you have this piece of bread, like we have this bread here with a lot of mold on it, um-
student_FUNGI : ...it will be just fungi, there won’t be any bread.
teacher_FUNGI : What about some of the other ones, how do they adapt?
student_FUNGI : You see it spread, it like spreads around the bread. They’re all different hosts and they have to adapt to the different host.
teacher_FUNGI : Ok, can you give me an example that you might have seen, or?
student_FUNGI : well, the difference between some of the mushrooms, is like, I think that’s the fungi on this one, and that’s way different between- from say this example, and I’m assuming this is maybe in a wetter climate.
teacher_FUNGI : So these adaptations are for what reason?
student_FUNGI : Uh, to live, like, to survive.
teacher_FUNGI : To gain some of the nutrients it might need?
student_FUNGI : Yeah.
teacher_FUNGI : Um, what about, how do they reproduce?
student_FUNGI : I think it’s binary fission.
teacher_FUNGI : Just like what we talked about with uh ..., so that might be something that might be something that’s listed where how are fungi different from plants, you know, like, they reproduce kind of like plants reproduce. Plants reproduce by binary fission
student_FUNGI : No, No. They did the, Pollen. The pollen spreading. Pollination.
teacher_FUNGI : So are we moving on to the next part where it’s basic things they need to survive, just so you guys are already thinking about that list and that might be a good idea, you can use that to-
student_FUNGI : We need to make sure how they reproduce. The yeast is alive, like yogurt.
teacher_FUNGI : Yogurt, what do you mean?
student_FUNGI : Like, because it’s alive, but not alive alive.
teacher_FUNGI : Oh, ok. So what were you guys talking about before that?
student_FUNGI : Um, he he kept saying that mushrooms are living organisms and like they don’t feed on dead organisms, or something like that. That would make fungus a cannibal.
teacher_FUNGI : It would make them a cannibal?
student_FUNGI : Well, I thought mushrooms and fungus are not dead organisms usually.
teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, I mean like, what are some examples that you’ve seen them growing on?
student_FUNGI : Decaying wood
teacher_FUNGI : On decaying wood. Anywhere else?
student_FUNGI : Uh, on old food. Like, wet, wet, old clammy places. Like, one time I took a bunch of sand and, uh, dirt and water and everything and then put it in an airtight container, and in like two days mold started to grow.
teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, how did it get there?
student_FUNGI : I think it’s like because of the climate, and I think it’s like, I think it’s, being like carried, like carried along, and then it like, kinda like emerges, like grows
teacher_FUNGI : Would you say like, well, but how come it wasn’t growing when you first obtained it?
student_FUNGI : Because it’s not, uh, it’s maybe because they didn’t like that habitat so they stay hidden.
teacher_FUNGI : So what are some things that maybe all, all fungi need in order to like emerge?
student_FUNGI : Like wetness
teacher_FUNGI : Wet stuff, ok
student_FUNGI : And it’s usually dark, they’re usually in dark places.
teacher_FUNGI : Where did you keep them, when you-?
student_FUNGI : Uh, I kept them on my windowsill, but there’s like a bunch of trees blocking the windowsill so not a lot of light comes through
teacher_FUNGI : Ok
student_FUNGI : Some like dark areas and cold areas similar to ...Like, because, in the forest there’s usually not much light and uh, I went with my family where, for edible mushrooms and they like all grow in the dark shadows.
teacher_FUNGI : Why would they grow in those kinds of areas, you think?
student_FUNGI : It’s their natural habitat?
teacher_FUNGI : when you think about plants, plants grow in certain areas, um, to survive, and get sunlight and whatnot. Um, why would fungi grow in like the dark woods are they getting anything from it?
student_FUNGI : Wetness. Water. Food that they need to survive.
teacher_FUNGI : Um, sure. When you- You guys talked about a lot of good stuff. As you’re, um, going back through this maybe you can add some of those ideas you just talked about.
student_FUNGI : Ew
teacher_FUNGI : Pull them out
student_FUNGI : They’re still wet
teacher_FUNGI : You can even kinda touch them
student_FUNGI : It’s soggy. Yeah see- like wetness. I like it, put water
teacher_FUNGI : How is this, uh, how is this like the, the fruit that you just saw?
student_FUNGI : Well it’s like it looks really old and it’s like, it’s wet. So I think it does have to have a wet climate because this is wet and like the fruit was wet, and I added water to that, my little, uh, stuff that I made, so that’s probably why-
teacher_FUNGI : So you’re saying that if I used like dry bread it wouldn’t at all, you wouldn’t see any mold?
student_FUNGI : No, it’s not that- just not as much, not as fast. Because it would gain water eventually from air.
teacher_FUNGI : Um, so it takes time for mold to grow. Um, why? Why does it take so much time?
student_FUNGI : Because it still has, it probably still has to, uh, um, break out the egg or reproduce or something like that.
teacher_FUNGI : Reproduce. Ok. In what way though, like, what do you mean? So when you’re looking at this here you’re saying that as it gets bigger and bigger and bigger you’re saying that it’s reproducing or that it’s growing?
student_FUNGI : It could be growing or reproducing.
teacher_FUNGI : What do you guys think?
student_FUNGI : I think it’s growing
teacher_FUNGI : You think it’s growing. You’re saying reproducing, so when you’re looking at all these different types of fungi too, are they all, like, reproducing in the same way you think?
student_FUNGI : Kind of, because like some of the mushrooms are connected, in a way.
teacher_FUNGI : Oh, they’re all connected? Do you see that in any of the other kind of fungi here? What about this one here? Are they all like, maybe connected at some point? Or is that like one, like, one mushroom here and just ...?
student_FUNGI : Like trees that can, like, grow more of them because they’re on the same tree.
teacher_FUNGI : Well, look at, look through some more of these pictures here, any other similarities, like how there’s tons of mushroom here, are there some patterns that you see as well?
student_FUNGI : Like here the bread is kind of dry and there’s not that much mold visible.
teacher_FUNGI : Oh, that’s a good, that’s a good observation.
teacher_FUNGI : Um, let’s hear some ideas that you have right now. What are some things that you notice that maybe are similar or different? Joe?
student_FUNGI : Um, they have, well they have, some fungus are attached to trees and we don’t.
teacher_FUNGI : Ok, great. They grow on different things. So I heard- what did you say?
student_FUNGI : I said that, uh, fungus attaches to different things like trees and we don’t.
teacher_FUNGI : Does anyone want to add to that idea or shoot off with a new idea?
student_FUNGI : Uh, well, they need a host to grow on.
teacher_FUNGI : Ok, I’ll add that on here.
student_FUNGI : And they need a brain.
teacher_FUNGI : So let's go back to that idea. Why do they need a host, what's a host?
student_FUNGI : Uh, sort of like, uh...
teacher_FUNGI : You can give me an example.
student_FUNGI : Like we eat candy bars and cereal, but that could be its nutrience and its food it eats, just like how plants, how they need water, sun, and air to create the sugar that they make.
teacher_FUNGI : So fungi grow on things for their food.
student_FUNGI : They might grow on other things for protection.
teacher_FUNGI : Oh, for protection, too. Could you maybe give us an example?
student_FUNGI : Like, some animals might like to eat that fungus and maybe it would be harder to find it on the tree or whatever it's on.
teacher_FUNGI : You think the thing might have some kind of predator or something that might want to eat it?
student_FUNGI : Yeah, maybe.
teacher_FUNGI : Any other ideas, off of that one?
student_FUNGI : Um, we move and talk and they just kind of stay in one place and don't have a language that we know of.
teacher_FUNGI : I like what you said, they have a language we don't know of, so maybe they have a language.
teacher_FUNGI : Alright so, they don't move. Anything else? Rebecca.
student_FUNGI : They use runners to grow.
teacher_FUNGI : Can you say that a little louder?
student_FUNGI : Runners.
teacher_FUNGI : Water?
student_FUNGI : Runners.
teacher_FUNGI : What are those?
student_FUNGI : What they do is recreate a part of themselves, they grow on other trees and use things called "runners."
teacher_FUNGI : What are runners, what do they look like? Have you seen them before?
teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying they have...let's talk about the mold, so you're saying theres' runners?
student_FUNGI : They can replant themselves.
teacher_FUNGI : So it would just be a part of themselves that keeps growing and branching outward?
student_FUNGI : Yeah.
teacher_FUNGI : Sounds good.
teacher_FUNGI : Let's go ahead and continue where we left off yesterday. We were talking about how fungi are like and unlike plants.
student_FUNGI : You said they don't need photosynthesis, I'm thinking they just have the water to stay hydrated but they get their nutrience from like, maybe the dirty stuff that's around them, cause almost everything has nutrience.
teacher_FUNGI : So they get stuff from everything that's around them? Anyone want to add to that? Alex?
student_FUNGI : Maybe they get food from the host they're growing on?
teacher_FUNGI : For food, so, and then, Ollie was saying some of the rotten stuff around them. Anika?
student_FUNGI : I agree with Alex, with the bread, we saw that the bread got thinner, so we're thinking that the bacteria, or the fungi took out of the bread. And also with fruits and vegetables it like shrivels the food up.
teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying they kind of break things, break that down like in a stomach? Yeah, Patrick?
student_FUNGI : Maybe it has to stay wet to live, so that's why it doesn't live in lighted places, so like it doesn't dry up or something.
teacher_FUNGI : So it's one of the conditions. Okay.
teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, James?
student_FUNGI : Well they probably eat the host, because if the size decreases, it might be the fungus eating it.
teacher_FUNGI : It must be eating it. So if you're looking at the picture of the orange with fungus all over it, is it growing on it because of moisture? Is it growing on it because it's doing something else? What do you guys think about that?
teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Kevin?
student_FUNGI : Well, first of all, maybe the orange is in a dark place, and that in turn helps the orange to grow.
teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so it just needs the moisture that's on there, it'll live on anything that's moist, maybe?
student_FUNGI : I'm thinking that the bacteria and fungus is always there, it's just microscopic so you can't see it, and if the food isn't eaten before it starts rotting, that's when the bacteria and the mold start feeding off of it and that's when it grows so we can see it.
teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so food has to get rotten first before mold grows on it. How many of you agree with that, food has to get rotten first before mold grows on it, or, food is rotten because mold grows on it. How many of you agree with the first statement? Raise your hands. How many of you agree with the second statement? So what's going on there?
student_FUNGI : Maybe when maggots eat it, maybe like, when the maggots, their waste creates a mold, or a fungi? When there's mold there's fungi?
teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying that the fungi are similar to the maggots that eat the...?
student_FUNGI : Or maybe the waste creates the fungi, as it eats it.
teacher_FUNGI : So the maggots eat the dead thing and it will create a fungus?
student_FUNGI : I don't know, yeah.
teacher_FUNGI : Maybe someone help me out. Ben?
student_FUNGI : I don't think that they really eat the food, I think they suck out all the water, cause water mostly makes up a fruit's mass, so if it shrivels and loses most of its mass, that must mean that the water's getting out. And also, whenever I see fungi, it seems like it has a bunch of moisture around it, I'm wondering if it's because its water inside it is evaporated.
teacher_FUNGI : Okay, you mean like if it's in a bag, and it has moisture in it? So we see it growing on places with water. And it needs moisture to grow.
teacher_FUNGI : Let's talk about this idea more. If they're growing on places you thought, do you think they're getting anything out of that at all? Like rotten food. Would you eat rotten food? Do you think most living things would want to eat rotten food?
student_FUNGI : No.
teacher_FUNGI : So what is rotten food? What does that mean when we say it's "rotten"?
student_FUNGI : It's kinda like expired, and like it's not good for you to eat because it makes you sick.
teacher_FUNGI : Okay, but why is it not good for you to eat, though?
student_FUNGI : But not all rotten is bad for you to eat, 'cause all cheese is rotten, because they make cheese with rotten milk, so not all rotten things are bad.
student_FUNGI : Maybe it's decomposing, so maybe the nutrience in it, like the freshness and the combining nutrience are like turning bad?
teacher_FUNGI : They're taking the stuff and turning it into...say that one more time.
student_FUNGI : The nutrience that used to be good for you, now are like, since it's rotten basically, the goodness is gone, so it's just nothing, it makes you sick.
teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying...the "goodness", what is goodness?
student_FUNGI : It's the stuff like the nutrience that's good for you.
teacher_FUNGI : Like what?
student_FUNGI : Like the vitamins and everything?
teacher_FUNGI : Like vitamins and what not. Okay so you're saying that fungi start off on fresh stuff, and then they break stuff down and take all the goodness away, is that what you're saying?
teacher_FUNGI : I'm trying to see if I'm getting the right idea down.
student_FUNGI : Yeah.
teacher_FUNGI : Anyone want to add to that? Maybe I'm thinking differently to what Ollie is saying.
student_FUNGI : I don't think they start out on fresh stuff, because I think when it starts to go bad, they form on it because I think they're attracted to food that goes bad. Cause, I dont' know, you dont' just buy a really fresh loaf of bread and then the next day fungus grows on it. It's like maybe after 2 weeks you see fungus growing on it.
teacher_FUNGI : Where did it come from then? How did fungus get on things you seal completely? Any ideas?
teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Ben?
student_FUNGI : They probably travel through air or touch.
teacher_FUNGI : Like what parts of them, they just like float through the air, so you're saying we've got fungus all around us right now, you think?
student_FUNGI : Well, I don't know, maybe people inhale them and breathe them out?
teacher_FUNGI : Travel through air.
teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Grace.
student_FUNGI : I think if you... when you touch it, and there's fungus or bacteria on your hands, then after a while it starts to add up.
teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so once we like touch a type of... let's say you've got fungus on your hand or fungus is in the air, and it gets onto something, if it's so microscopic then how is it we can see it? We've got like the strawberries that had mold all over, the blackberries that are growing mold all around it, isn't it microscopic, though? how's it getting, why can we see it?
teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Ian, what do you think?
student_FUNGI : Like binary fission?
teacher_FUNGI : Binary, what do you mean by that? Can you tell me what that is?
student_FUNGI : Like cells keep constantly dividing, so it's not one cell, it's like a million cells each one from one original?
teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so you're saying bacteria do binary fission, so are you saying they are multiplying?
teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Ollie.
student_FUNGI : Since there's like lots and lots of bacteria like billions in this cubic centimeter there can't just be one to reproduce all of that. I bet like, since it's getting all its nutrience from the fruit, since it's being really healthy and all, it starts reproducing all of them, that's why it grows so much that we can see it.
teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying there's a bunch of different types of fungus that's growing? Or it's just one individual that keeps growing?
student_FUNGI : It's lots of types.
teacher_FUNGI : Let's go back to this idea of, they grow on other things as a host, and it breaks things down. How might it break it down? Or how might it be similar to how we break things down? Any similarities you can think of?
teacher_FUNGI : Patrick?
student_FUNGI : Well like, our stomachs have acids that break things down, so maybe like the acids break things down?
teacher_FUNGI : They use acids.
student_FUNGI : But when Ben said when a fruit breaks things down it decomposes, so more nutrience comes out, so wouldn't it be better to eat rotten fruit than fresh fruit?
teacher_FUNGI : Hmm, good question. Alex do you have an answer?
student_FUNGI : I'm pretty sure that when something decomposes, the nutrience are leaving whatever is decomposing is going into the soil or whatever, so that's why we have composts.
teacher_FUNGI : Like composts in what way?
student_FUNGI : To help make...hmm.
teacher_FUNGI : So that's something we can think about, so part of adding nutrience is maybe like composts? Claire?
student_FUNGI : I think the nutrience for us is when it's not rotting and the nutrience for other things like gardens and stuff is when it is rotting, cause if you put like banana peels and things like that into a compost bin, it turns into dirt and has tons of nutrience and it's really good for growing things, so um, fungi could also help break down things like that. It does have nutrience for other things.
teacher_FUNGI : Great, so maybe it's like compost and it provides things for other things, like dirt for nutrience?
teacher_FUNGI : So we have a great start here. We've got so many ideas up here that are really great. Some of them kind of are different from one another or contradict one another, but we're going to start trying to figure out how these kind of connec tto one another, maybe figure out how do fungi decompose, how do they move, do they move at all? Do they grow in moist places? Why do they do some of these things? So we're gonna talk about that more during this unit. What questions do you have that maybe we can try to answer as we go along as well? Yesterday's homework I actually made you think of a couple questions, what questions do you have about fungi? Yeah, Ben?
student_FUNGI : Can they rot still living things?
teacher_FUNGI : Can they rot food?
student_FUNGI : Like, rot still living things?
teacher_FUNGI : Oh, okay. You're using rot like a verb? Can they rot living things.
teacher_FUNGI : Any other questions? Ollie.
student_FUNGI : If we eat a rotting fruit, is the fungi what makes us sick?
teacher_FUNGI : Any other questions you have, yeah, Amy?
student_FUNGI : How do fungi eat?
teacher_FUNGI : How DO fungi eat?
student_FUNGI : Why do fungi make that terrible smell?
teacher_FUNGI : Do they all make that smell? Good question.
student_FUNGI : How do they reproduce?
teacher_FUNGI : How do they reproduce.
teacher_FUNGI : Um, Yadi.
student_FUNGI : How many parts do they have?
teacher_FUNGI : How many parts do they have.
teacher_FUNGI : That's real good.
teacher_FUNGI : Um, Roxton and then Patrick.
student_FUNGI : Is mushroom a fungi?
teacher_FUNGI : Patrick?
student_FUNGI : How does fungi acquire nutrience?
teacher_FUNGI : How does it acquire nutrience.
teacher_FUNGI : Any others?
teacher_FUNGI : Kevin?
student_FUNGI : Well, can it survive if it's like extreme heat?
teacher_FUNGI : As we're going along, too, we'll add questions if we have more. This is a great place to start off.Teacher_FUNGI : Oh you know what, let's remember that question that we talked about for the warm up.  What are some ways that fungi affect you? What did you put down?
Student_FUNGI : They kill us
Teacher_FUNGI : They can kill us? In what way?
Student_FUNGI : Poisonous?
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so there are some that are poisonous. Yeah?
Student_FUNGI : They grow on our feet and make it hard to find a date.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay. Hey, great answer. For those unfortunate few of us. Yes?
Student_FUNGI : They grow on our food.
Teacher_FUNGI : They grow on our food. 
Teacher_FUNGI : Any other ways they affect our lives?
Student_FUNGI : They are food
Teacher_FUNGI : They are food. Okay, Ollie? 
Student_FUNGI : They gross us out.
Teacher_FUNGI : They can do that, yeah.
Student_FUNGI : My brother doesn't like them, so he doesn't like them in his food.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so he just rolls it up and sticks it in there?
Student_FUNGI : Yeah. It smells.
Teacher_FUNGI : It smells. Let's see, how would they impact our life, like if we didn't have fungi in our world, would it be a better place? Would it not be a better place? Ben?
Student_FUNGI : It wouldn't be better because the cycle would be, cause we need to have things decompose.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so maybe we need things to help decompose, to be part of the cycle. 
Student_FUNGI : We wouldn't have mac'n'cheese.
Teacher_FUNGI : We wouldn't have mac'n'cheese, why? Why is that? How is that?
Student_FUNGI : Because cheese is a fungus.
Teacher_FUNGI : Cheese is a fungus maybe?
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay so let's talk about some of these throughout this activity here. So as you go through these I want you to think about this question. There are a lot of different roles they play. And what type of organisms are affected by them? We already know obviously they affect us but are there other organisms that might be affected by them? Um, and then give me some examples, describe and give me some examples.
Student_FUNGI : Ew, it's bread mold. It can grow on many foods not just bread. It looks fuzzy and can be black, white, green, or grey colored.
Teacher_FUNGI : So you guys were saying that they, looking at this, release enzymes that break down organic material. What does that mean, though?
Student_FUNGI : They break down things like yeast and salt... And things that are organic. 
Teacher_FUNGI : So if we didn't have some of things to break things down, what do you think it would look like? 
Student_FUNGI : A big pile of dead... Compost. Not even rotting. 
Teacher_FUNGI : Would they be rotting? 
Student_FUNGI : I don't think so. Because rotting requires fungi. I picture it as like a huge landfill. Not only fungus, but also bacteria also rocks. 
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh okay, how do they feed it?
Student_FUNGI : How do they feed it? Umm...
Teacher_FUNGI : Cause if you want to eat an apple, you don't just swallow a whole apple, right?
Student_FUNGI : Yeah. So...
Teacher_FUNGI : Take a look at how maybe, how...
Student_FUNGI : I think they kind of have acids in them, well, I don't know.
Teacher_FUNGI : Rebecca was talking about how we've got things being decomposed, organic materials being decomposed. Are they similar?
Student_FUNGI : Maybe it breaks it down into a liquid and then soaks it up like it was water? Like a sponge. Then, since when it grows it needs more water to keep growing, it just breaks it down, sort of like our stomach. 
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so if we left that bread for a very very long time, what do you think would happen to that fungi?
Student_FUNGI : Probably be gone? I mean maybe the fungi would die out unless there was another food near it?T_FUNGI : What I'm going to have you do is try to use all the following key words here. These are some of the words that kinda came up when you were looking at the different types of fungi earlier, before break, um, digestion, decomposinig, nutriets, rotting. So I'd like you to try to use all those key words there to explain what you thinks happening over time in the ziploc bag with the strawberries. Yes, Alex, great.
S_FUNGI : Well, What's happening over time in the ziploc bag is the strawberries are rotting and decomposing. What's cauing this might be that the mold growing on it gathers the strawberries nutrients through digestion and the strawberry starts to shrivel up and break.
T_FUNGI : Great. So you said what's happening is rotting and decomposing. Is that the same thing? That you're talking about you think? Or are they two different things that are going on? And this can be a question for anybody. Alex used it. I saw a lot of people using it. A lot of people said the stawberries were decomposing and rotting. Are those two different things that are happening? What do you say?
S_FUNGI : Yeah, I think it's two different things. Um, when they rot, the mold starts to grow on them to get the nutrients. But when they decompose then it, um, more of them are falling apart.
T_FUNGI : But what's causing them to fall apart?
S_FUNGI : Well, the mold just being on the nutrients I guess.
T_FUNGI : Ok. So depends on what you're saying. Same thing? Are they the same thing?
S_FUNGI : Well, I think it depends more, more than a ton. the last stage where it um falls apart and rotting
T_FUNGI : Ok. So any other ideas? Tory?
S_FUNGI : Um, the mold is, I think that rotting is the mold taking out the nutrients like up to the surface so the mold can digest it. And decomposing is where the actual material of the strawberry starts to fall apart and become compost.
T_FUNGI : Because, what reason?
S_FUNGI : Because the mold is, all the nutrients are out of the strawberries so that’s basically what makes up the fruit
T_FUNGI : Ok. So I'm hearing kinda a couple of things here. It sounds like you and James have really similar ideas here, where you're saying that um, mold, or fungus, is the cause of both of those rotting and decomposing, but they're two different parts of the same overall thing, that you're saying, right?
T_FUNGI : Any other ideas? About whats going on inside here. Maybe we can add a couple of these ideas that you just talked about onto our concept map up here. So, you guys remember this? From back in the day? We put a lot of great ideas on here. Um, let's talk about what you guys just shared here. So we got decompose, take the goodness away, parts of a cycle, and add nutrients like compost. So, We're talking about decomposing and rotting maybe being two different topic things, maybe? Um, I'll add what you said two stages. Um, What I'm going to have you guys do is um, look up some of these words in picture pockets we have available here with the info, and see if you can get a better idea of some of the definitions of the words, because when I walked around a lot of people asked what does decomposing mean? Can you describe how do you digest food?
S_FUNGI : I eat it.
T_FUNGI : Eat it! Yeah, can you describe that process for me?
S_FUNGI : I chew it.
T_FUNGI : Or anybody else, you can help, how do you digest food?
S_FUNGI : And then I swallow. And then it breaks it down.
T_FUNGI : What breaks it down?
S_FUNGI : Acids. In my stomach.
T_FUNGI : Ok, great. And then what? And then where does it go from there?
S_FUNGI : It goes down in
T_FUNGI : Well, I mean, like you eat it and it breaks down. But I mean, why are you eating in the first place?
S_FUNGI : To get energy.
T_FUNGI : To give you energy. So how are you getting that energy after you break it down?
S_FUNGI : By taking nutrients from the food.
T_FUNGI : Ok. Um, so then describe how fungus is doing that. Is that the same?
S_FUNGI : They absorb it through their cell membrane.
T_FUNGI : Are we kinda doing that too? We got lots of cells in our body and we're absorbing them kinda all of the cells within our body doing that?
S_FUNGI : The germs frist break it down
T_FUNGI : They first break it down, ok. So how does this process here, is this process different from what we're doing?
S_FUNGI : Yes.
T_FUNGI : Why is it called extracellular? What does that mean?
S_FUNGI : More cells?
T_FUNGI : No idea? Why don't you guys take a look at a couple more of these here. Just compare what they're saying about the extracellular, what are they doing here? So you want to kind of compare, maybe, most of them here to see if there might be any differences. Because some of them are really similar, but you might obtain more information by looking at one or two more.
T_FUNGI : So we talked about extracellular digestion already, yeah?
S_FUNGI : Yeah
T_FUNGI : What is it?
S_FUNGI : The process where fungus breaks down food to simple sugars and absorbs with cellular membranes
S_FUNGI : No, no. It's the way fungus digests foods where enzyms break the organiz material into sugars and take the sugars into the cell membrane for energy.
T_FUNGI : Ah, interesting. So isn't that the same thing you're doing then? When you eat?
S_FUNGI : Pretty much.
T_FUNGI : Yeah? But how is that different though?
S_FUNGI : We don't use enzymes?
T_FUNGI : Do we? We actually do have enzymes inside of our body.
S_FUNGI : Oh, ok.
S_FUNGI : We don’t have cell membranes?
T_FUNGI : We do have cell membranes.
T_FUNGI : So you just described this process where fungus is releasing enzymes, they're breaking it down and they're absorbing it. How do we do it?
S_FUNGI : We swallow it.
S_FUNGI : We chew and swallow it first.
T_FUNGI : We chew and swallow it first, so how are these two processes different?
S_FUNGI : This one is like straight to the stomach.
T_FUNGI : So they have a stomach?
S_FUNGI : Well they break it down first.
T_FUNGI : What?
S_FUNGI : They break it down first.
T_FUNGI : They break it down first, before they...
S_FUNGI : Like, swallow.
T_FUNGI : Ok. Well, what would that look like, if you wanted to, Lucy, I mean, I tell you eat like a fungus, here's a strawberry, eat like a fungus. What would you have to do?
S_FUNGI : I'd probably have to, um, I have no idea.
T_FUNGI : So, you have enzymes inside of your stomach, though.
S_FUNGI : Yeah, I'd probably have to cut open my stomach and use the enzymes to make me swallow.
T_FUNGI : Ok. And then the strawberries there, what do you do, to the strawberry?
S_FUNGI : Haha, probably go to the doctor's office.
T_FUNGI : Ok, stay focused, James, and then what happens? Since you released her enzyme, now what?
S_FUNGI : Um, the enzymes break down the organic material in the food.
T_FUNGI : Any then what does Lucy have to do?
S_FUNGI : I have to absorb it.
T_FUNGI : Ah, doesn't that kind of a graphic picture to think about? You have to expell something and then it gets broken down, and then you like get it back into your body somehow.
S_FUNGI : Ew.
T_FUNGI : Yeah. Great, so I want you to make sure you're adding that definition here so that makes it a little more clear for you guys.
T_FUNGI : It looks good. Um, so what do we got here? Um, can you tell me some of the relationships that you saw? So start anywhere and then you can go from there.
S_FUNGI : Ok, nutrients to sugars, because nutrients are broken down into sugars.
T_FUNGI : Great.
S_FUNGI : Um, enzymes to sugars, because um, releasing, the sugar is releasing enzymes or something
T_FUNGI : Enzymes are releasing sugars?
S_FUNGI : Or something was, I can't really remember.
T_FUNGI : You might want to, um, look through a couple more to help you refine that a little bit.
T_FUNGI : What did you get? Do you have something different?
S_FUNGI : Well, uh, that one I actually didn't write anything, but what happens is the enzymes are released then it breaks down the sugars to become nutrients.
T_FUNGI : It breaks down sugars?
S_FUNGI : Yeah.
T_FUNGI : Are you sure?
S_FUNGI : It breaks down organic stuff into simple sugars.
T_FUNGI : Oh, ok. So you're missing something there, so you might want to add that.
S_FUNGI : Oh, yeah.
T_FUNGI : Enzymes are breaking, so it's not breaking down sugar
S_FUNGI : It's breaking things down into sugar
T_FUNGI : Organic material into sugar. So what is organic materials? What are we talking about?
S_FUNGI : like leaves.
T_FUNGI : What about metal?
S_FUNGI : No, that's not organic, because it's made by people.
T_FUNGI : Ok, um, what about bread, people make bread.
S_FUNGI : It's made out of organics
T_FUNGI : So I want you to make sure you're kinda double checking yourself here you're saying, oh yes I understand that enzymes are related to starches.
T_FUNGI : Um, these are the seven key words hat you looked at yesterday. And I asked you to draw some lines and explain some relationships between some of those words. So I would like to start off by reviewing that. Um, can I have someone maybe start us off here, start off with any of those words and maybe tell me one of the relationships you saw between that and maybe another word. I know eveyone has bluish chips so let's have more volunteers. Audry.
S_FUNGI : Well, we could connect enzymes to starches because the,
T_FUNGI : Enzymes to starches, ok.
S_FUNGI : Because the enzymes, um, actually break down the starches.
T_FUNGI : So Enzymes, what are enzymes?
S_FUNGI : Oh, they're the, well they're like the chemicals that the fungi releases to go break down.
T_FUNGI : Great. Yes. And as I'm going through it on here if you want to add anything else to your journal that you don't have, you might want to do that, too. So we got, um, Audry said it's released, some kind of a chemical, released by the fungi. And so we used to words decomposing and rotting kind of together, um, what's the relationship between those two words? I'm going to have you guys talk to the person next to you then I'm going to call on someone at random. So what's the relationship between decomposing and rotting.
T_FUNGI : If I can get your attention back up here. Do we have any other volunteers, would anyone like to volunteer to tell us what this relationship is? Carley?
S_FUNGI : Um, after it rots it decomposes
T_FUNGI : After it rots it decomposes maybe? Ok.
S_FUNGI : Yeah.
T_FUNGI : Any other ideas out there? How about, Alex?
S_FUNGI : Um, well, I'm kinda thinking about what Carley said I think after it decomposes it rots because maybe rotting is when it has lost all of its nutrients
T_FUNGI : And decomposing would be…
S_FUNGI : Decomposing is just when it's losing its nutrients.
T_FUNGI : When you're losing it? Like in a process or something? Ok. Let's hear some others. How do you feel about decomposing or rotting
S_FUNGI : Look at it, what do you think it is?
T_FUNGI : I don't know, well you have to come up with a better definition. Is it the same thing? Or are they different?
S_FUNGI : I think decomposing is when it's starting to fall apart, and then rotting is just, um, leading up to it decomposing.
T_FUNGI : Aren't you still saying kind of the same things happening, maybe?
S_FUNGI : Well, yeah, but, when it's rotting it's still together, and when it decomposes it just,
T_FUNGI : Ok.
S_FUNGI : I think it's the other way around. Decomposing is like the breaking down of it and rotting is falling apart.
T_FUNGI : Ok. Um, I'm going to have you guys think about this. Decomposing, a lot of you guys ar defininf decomposing as, um, things being broken down. And some of you said rotting is something that's broken down already, too. So, in both of these processes here, what's breaking these things down? What's breaking the food or the trees or the plants down? We'll start off with you.
S_FUNGI : (inaudible)
T_FUNGI : Fungi, ok. Let's conocentrate on the fungi part. And fungi is doing this how?
S_FUNGI : By (inaudible)
T_FUNGI : Great. So we're doing this process here that we talked about. So this final stage after its gotten its nutrients, this whole kind of process is a description of decomposing, its kind of describing the whole process of extracellular digestion. We're seeing things decompose. And it's really so much a rotting too, things are being broken down, a lot of you were saying that. So these processes, decomposing and rotting, are pretty much the same thing, if you're looking at this, and it's hanging out in your fridge, that same process of enzymes breaking structures down into sugars is happening, isn't it? What do you guys think? Yeah? Can you guys see it happening here? Um, so, we're talking about decomposing and rotting kinda being a similar thing.
S_FUNGI : When we said that it was losing nutrients when it was rotting and decomposing, um, I don't think it is really losing nutrients, because we, because some people, like when they're done with their fruit or something and they don't want the rest they put it in a compost bin. And when it turns into compost, they use that for plants because it has good nutrients. So I don't think it loses nutrients.
T_FUNGI : Ok. But does it have the same amount oof nutrients it started off with?
S_FUNGI : I don't know.
T_FUNGI : So then what's happening then? It will probably have less nutrients, because we're talking about the fungus is getting some of the nutrients from that food. Does that make sense?Teacher_FUNGI : What I'm going to have you do is try to use all the following key words here.

Does that make sense?Teacher_FUNGI : Oh you know what, let's remember that question that we talked about for the warm up.  What are some ways that fungi affect you? What did you put down?
Student_FUNGI : They kill us
Teacher_FUNGI : They can kill us? In what way?
Student_FUNGI : Poisonous?
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so there are some that are poisonous. Yeah?
Student_FUNGI : They grow on our feet and make it hard to find a date.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay. Hey, great answer. For those unfortunate few of us. Yes?
Student_FUNGI : They grow on our food.
Teacher_FUNGI : They grow on our food. 
Teacher_FUNGI : Any other ways they affect our lives?
Student_FUNGI : They are food
Teacher_FUNGI : They are food. Okay, Ollie? 
Student_FUNGI : They gross us out.
Teacher_FUNGI : They can do that, yeah.
Student_FUNGI : My brother doesn't like them, so he doesn't like them in his food.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so he just rolls it up and sticks it in there?
Student_FUNGI : Yeah. It smells.
Teacher_FUNGI : It smells. Let's see, how would they impact our life, like if we didn't have fungi in our world, would it be a better place? Would it not be a better place? Ben?
Student_FUNGI : It wouldn't be better because the cycle would be, cause we need to have things decompose.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so maybe we need things to help decompose, to be part of the cycle. 
Student_FUNGI : We wouldn't have mac'n'cheese.
Teacher_FUNGI : We wouldn't have mac'n'cheese, why? Why is that? How is that?
Student_FUNGI : Because cheese is a fungus.
Teacher_FUNGI : Cheese is a fungus maybe?
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay so let's talk about some of these throughout this activity here. So as you go through these I want you to think about this question. There are a lot of different roles they play. And what type of organisms are affected by them? We already know obviously they affect us but are there other organisms that might be affected by them? Um, and then give me some examples, describe and give me some examples.
Student_FUNGI : Ew, it's bread mold. It can grow on many foods not just bread. It looks fuzzy and can be black, white, green, or grey colored.
Teacher_FUNGI : So you guys were saying that they, looking at this, release enzymes that break down organic material. What does that mean, though?
Student_FUNGI : They break down things like yeast and salt... And things that are organic. 
Teacher_FUNGI : So if we didn't have some of things to break things down, what do you think it would look like? 
Student_FUNGI : A big pile of dead... Compost. Not even rotting. 
Teacher_FUNGI : Would they be rotting? 
Student_FUNGI : I don't think so. Because rotting requires fungi. I picture it as like a huge landfill. Not only fungus, but also bacteria also rocks. 
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh okay, how do they feed it?
Student_FUNGI : How do they feed it? Umm...
Teacher_FUNGI : Cause if you want to eat an apple, you don't just swallow a whole apple, right?
Student_FUNGI : Yeah. So...
Teacher_FUNGI : Take a look at how maybe, how...
Student_FUNGI : I think they kind of have acids in them, well, I don't know.
Teacher_FUNGI : Rebecca was talking about how we've got things being decomposed, organic materials being decomposed. Are they similar?
Student_FUNGI : Maybe it breaks it down into a liquid and then soaks it up like it was water? Like a sponge. Then, since when it grows it needs more water to keep growing, it just breaks it down, sort of like our stomach. 
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so if we left that bread for a very very long time, what do you think would happen to that fungi?
Student_FUNGI : Probably be gone? I mean maybe the fungi would die out unless there was another food near it?Teacher_FUNGI : Good morning guys, we’re going to start
Student_FUNGI : It's too cold. Yeah it was cold outside.
Teacher_FUNGI : um, so let me show you the fungi unit, and so I have one warm-up question for you and its “where have you seen fungi?” jot down a couple of ideas. Ok, so where’s places where you might have seen fungi?
Student_FUNGI : In my backyard
Teacher_FUNGI : Great, in your backyard where though?
Student_FUNGI : Um, towards the mossy area, it’s hard to explain.
Teacher_FUNGI : Towards like the corner, or is it on…
Student_FUNGI : A bunch of mushrooms
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh, a bunch of mushrooms, in the hay.
Student_FUNGI : Something weird on its ..., its like a disease, that’s what the doctors say.
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh, what’d it look like?
Student_FUNGI : It was weird looking ...
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh ok, so you didn’t get to see what it looked like but you know it was growing on its foot?
Student_FUNGI : Like mushrooms on the trees in the woods.
Teacher_FUNGI : Ok, so in the natural environment?
Student_FUNGI : Those weird things that stick out of the sides of trees.
Teacher_FUNGI : Ok, so on trees.
Student_FUNGI : Um, on decrepit logs
Teacher_FUNGI : What do you mean (?)
Student_FUNGI : Like just rotted, like, like falling apart ... the fungi ...
Teacher_FUNGI : Ok, any other places? Yeah, Diana?
Student_FUNGI : In the grass in my front yard.
Teacher_FUNGI : In the back of your car?
Student_FUNGI : No, no. In the grass in my front yard.
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh, the grass, ok great.
Teacher_FUNGI : So we’ve seen fungi, um, sometime in our life, uh, whether it’s on food or in nature like on trees or whatnot, we’re gonna be looking at more examples today too, so we have activity 42 for you. So I want you to show me that’s one of the things as you’re going around, um, oh actually as it- as you’re working at your lab station. And at your lab station what you’ll find are some colored pictures of different types of fungi, so there are twelve different types that you can look through. Um, a good idea is to have all the pictures spread out at your lab station so you can look at all of them together. And there are different bins with different types of things in them. So for instance, this station here has um, some fruit, that has uh, fungi growing on them. So you’ll make some observations uh about some of the things you see here. Remember we’re practicing our observations like we did at the beginning of the day. So uh, what kinds of things can you observe when you’re looking at these?
Student_FUNGI : Uh, that they’re really old and not healthy.
Teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, so you’re making observations like that, some visual observations that maybe make- it also you can maybe make some guesses about what you think is happening inside some of these things too. So this station here has, um, fruit with mold on it. Um, I’ve got another station with mushrooms on it. Um, another one with petri dishes with mushrooms on them. And I think, um, some fungi growing as well. So, you can take a look- oh and bread, bread growing, uh, mold growing on bread. So when you’re uh, when you’re looking at the different bins here you’re looking at some of the different type of fungi um, and when you’re done, um, I’m going to give every group maybe about six or seven minutes. I’d like the team managers up at the front to kinda keep an eye on the clock, so at about every six or seven minutes I’d like you to take your bin and pass it to the next station, we’ll go in this order.
Student_FUNGI : oh, oh, I can smell the pepper
Teacher_FUNGI : Which part are you working on?
Student_FUNGI : We’re working on ...
Teacher_FUNGI : Ok, so you have a good list here, where are you getting this list from?
Student_FUNGI : From the ...
Teacher_FUNGI : Ah, so your journal is a helpful tool, huh? Ok, so can you maybe describe what you guys know, some examples (?), like they, they made food, what do you mean by that, oh they make food, so you’re saying that-
Student_FUNGI : No we need food, we need, in our ...
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh they need food, so they don’t make their your own. How do you know? Do you know that for sure?
Student_FUNGI : No, it’s something they do. Photosynthesis.
Teacher_FUNGI : What are some examples? How do you know they make their own food? What are you basing it off of?
Student_FUNGI : Because, well they, normally they always have something- they’re always arguing, they always pretend they’re not growing out of the ground ...
Teacher_FUNGI : Ok, so they- yeah, what’d you say?
Student_FUNGI : It needs a host so it becomes a host.
Teacher_FUNGI : Um, so, how is it getting the nutrients from it? We know that plants make their own food. We eat food, we eat it with our mouth, how are they eating their food?
Student_FUNGI : I don’t know, they eat bacteria. It decomposes.
Teacher_FUNGI : What do you mean by that?
Student_FUNGI : Like, like, like it disappears after a while and the bacteria’s just left.
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh, ok, so that’s like when you have this piece of bread, like we have this bread here with a lot of mold on it, um-
Student_FUNGI : ...it will be just fungi, there won’t be any bread.
Teacher_FUNGI : What about some of the other ones, how do they adapt?
Student_FUNGI : You see it spread, it like spreads around the bread. They’re all different hosts and they have to adapt to the different host.
Teacher_FUNGI : Ok, can you give me an example that you might have seen, or?
Student_FUNGI : well, the difference between some of the mushrooms, is like, I think that’s the fungi on this one, and that’s way different between- from say this example, and I’m assuming this is maybe in a wetter climate.
Teacher_FUNGI : So these adaptations are for what reason?
Student_FUNGI : Uh, to live, like, to survive.
Teacher_FUNGI : To gain some of the nutrients it might need?
Student_FUNGI : Yeah.
Teacher_FUNGI : Um, what about, how do they reproduce?
Student_FUNGI : I think it’s binary fission.
Teacher_FUNGI : Just like what we talked about with uh ..., so that might be something that might be something that’s listed where how are fungi different from plants, you know, like, they reproduce kind of like plants reproduce. Plants reproduce by binary fission
Student_FUNGI : No, No. They did the, Pollen. The pollen spreading. Pollination.
Teacher_FUNGI : So are we moving on to the next part where it’s basic things they need to survive, just so you guys are already thinking about that list and that might be a good idea, you can use that to-
Student_FUNGI : We need to make sure how they reproduce. The yeast is alive, like yogurt.
Teacher_FUNGI : Yogurt, what do you mean?
Student_FUNGI : Like, because it’s alive, but not alive alive.
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh, ok. So what were you guys talking about before that?
Student_FUNGI : Um, he he kept saying that mushrooms are living organisms and like they don’t feed on dead organisms, or something like that. That would make fungus a cannibal.
Teacher_FUNGI : It would make them a cannibal?
Student_FUNGI : Well, I thought mushrooms and fungus are not dead organisms usually.
Teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, I mean like, what are some examples that you’ve seen them growing on?
Student_FUNGI : Decaying wood
Teacher_FUNGI : On decaying wood. Anywhere else?
Student_FUNGI : Uh, on old food. Like, wet, wet, old clammy places. Like, one time I took a bunch of sand and, uh, dirt and water and everything and then put it in an airtight container, and in like two days mold started to grow.
Teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, how did it get there?
Student_FUNGI : I think it’s like because of the climate, and I think it’s like, I think it’s, being like carried, like carried along, and then it like, kinda like emerges, like grows
Teacher_FUNGI : Would you say like, well, but how come it wasn’t growing when you first obtained it?
Student_FUNGI : Because it’s not, uh, it’s maybe because they didn’t like that habitat so they stay hidden.
Teacher_FUNGI : So what are some things that maybe all, all fungi need in order to like emerge?
Student_FUNGI : Like wetness
Teacher_FUNGI : Wet stuff, ok
Student_FUNGI : And it’s usually dark, they’re usually in dark places.
Teacher_FUNGI : Where did you keep them, when you-?
Student_FUNGI : Uh, I kept them on my windowsill, but there’s like a bunch of trees blocking the windowsill so not a lot of light comes through
Teacher_FUNGI : Ok
Student_FUNGI : Some like dark areas and cold areas similar to ...Like, because, in the forest there’s usually not much light and uh, I went with my family where, for edible mushrooms and they like all grow in the dark shadows.
Teacher_FUNGI : Why would they grow in those kinds of areas, you think?
Student_FUNGI : It’s their natural habitat?
Teacher_FUNGI : when you think about plants, plants grow in certain areas, um, to survive, and get sunlight and whatnot. Um, why would fungi grow in like the dark woods are they getting anything from it?
Student_FUNGI : Wetness. Water. Food that they need to survive.
Teacher_FUNGI : Um, sure. When you- You guys talked about a lot of good stuff. As you’re, um, going back through this maybe you can add some of those ideas you just talked about.
Student_FUNGI : Ew
Teacher_FUNGI : Pull them out
Student_FUNGI : They’re still wet
Teacher_FUNGI : You can even kinda touch them
Student_FUNGI : It’s soggy. Yeah see- like wetness. I like it, put water
Teacher_FUNGI : How is this, uh, how is this like the, the fruit that you just saw?
Student_FUNGI : Well it’s like it looks really old and it’s like, it’s wet. So I think it does have to have a wet climate because this is wet and like the fruit was wet, and I added water to that, my little, uh, stuff that I made, so that’s probably why-
Teacher_FUNGI : So you’re saying that if I used like dry bread it wouldn’t at all, you wouldn’t see any mold?
Student_FUNGI : No, it’s not that- just not as much, not as fast. Because it would gain water eventually from air.
Teacher_FUNGI : Um, so it takes time for mold to grow. Um, why? Why does it take so much time?
Student_FUNGI : Because it still has, it probably still has to, uh, um, break out the egg or reproduce or something like that.
Teacher_FUNGI : Reproduce. Ok. In what way though, like, what do you mean? So when you’re looking at this here you’re saying that as it gets bigger and bigger and bigger you’re saying that it’s reproducing or that it’s growing?
Student_FUNGI : It could be growing or reproducing.
Teacher_FUNGI : What do you guys think?
Student_FUNGI : I think it’s growing
Teacher_FUNGI : You think it’s growing. You’re saying reproducing, so when you’re looking at all these different types of fungi too, are they all, like, reproducing in the same way you think?
Student_FUNGI : Kind of, because like some of the mushrooms are connected, in a way.
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh, they’re all connected? Do you see that in any of the other kind of fungi here? What about this one here? Are they all like, maybe connected at some point? Or is that like one, like, one mushroom here and just ...?
Student_FUNGI : Like trees that can, like, grow more of them because they’re on the same tree.
Teacher_FUNGI : Well, look at, look through some more of these pictures here, any other similarities, like how there’s tons of mushroom here, are there some patterns that you see as well?
Student_FUNGI : Like here the bread is kind of dry and there’s not that much mold visible.
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh, that’s a good, that’s a good observation.
Teacher_FUNGI : Um, let’s hear some ideas that you have right now. What are some things that you notice that maybe are similar or different? Joe?
Student_FUNGI : Um, they have, well they have, some fungus are attached to trees and we don’t.
Teacher_FUNGI : Ok, great. They grow on different things. So I heard- what did you say?
Student_FUNGI : I said that, uh, fungus attaches to different things like trees and we don’t.
Teacher_FUNGI : Does anyone want to add to that idea or shoot off with a new idea?
Student_FUNGI : Uh, well, they need a host to grow on.
Teacher_FUNGI : Ok, I’ll add that on here.
Student_FUNGI : And they need a brain.
Teacher_FUNGI : So let's go back to that idea. Why do they need a host, what's a host?
Student_FUNGI : Uh, sort of like, uh...
Teacher_FUNGI : You can give me an example.
Student_FUNGI : Like we eat candy bars and cereal, but that could be its nutrience and its food it eats, just like how plants, how they need water, sun, and air to create the sugar that they make.
Teacher_FUNGI : So fungi grow on things for their food.
Student_FUNGI : They might grow on other things for protection.
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh, for protection, too. Could you maybe give us an example?
Student_FUNGI : Like, some animals might like to eat that fungus and maybe it would be harder to find it on the tree or whatever it's on.
Teacher_FUNGI : You think the thing might have some kind of predator or something that might want to eat it?
Student_FUNGI : Yeah, maybe.
Teacher_FUNGI : Any other ideas, off of that one?
Student_FUNGI : Um, we move and talk and they just kind of stay in one place and don't have a language that we know of.
Teacher_FUNGI : I like what you said, they have a language we don't know of, so maybe they have a language.
Teacher_FUNGI : Alright so, they don't move. Anything else? Rebecca.
Student_FUNGI : They use runners to grow.
Teacher_FUNGI : Can you say that a little louder?
Student_FUNGI : Runners.
Teacher_FUNGI : Water?
Student_FUNGI : Runners.
Teacher_FUNGI : What are those?
Student_FUNGI : What they do is recreate a part of themselves, they grow on other trees and use things called "runners."
Teacher_FUNGI : What are runners, what do they look like? Have you seen them before?
Teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying they have...let's talk about the mold, so you're saying theres' runners?
Student_FUNGI : They can replant themselves.
Teacher_FUNGI : So it would just be a part of themselves that keeps growing and branching outward?
Student_FUNGI : Yeah.
Teacher_FUNGI : Sounds good.
Teacher_FUNGI : Let's go ahead and continue where we left off yesterday. We were talking about how fungi are like and unlike plants.
Student_FUNGI : You said they don't need photosynthesis, I'm thinking they just have the water to stay hydrated but they get their nutrience from like, maybe the dirty stuff that's around them, cause almost everything has nutrience.
Teacher_FUNGI : So they get stuff from everything that's around them? Anyone want to add to that? Alex?
Student_FUNGI : Maybe they get food from the host they're growing on?
Teacher_FUNGI : For food, so, and then, Ollie was saying some of the rotten stuff around them. Anika?
Student_FUNGI : I agree with Alex, with the bread, we saw that the bread got thinner, so we're thinking that the bacteria, or the fungi took out of the bread. And also with fruits and vegetables it like shrivels the food up.
Teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying they kind of break things, break that down like in a stomach? Yeah, Patrick?
Student_FUNGI : Maybe it has to stay wet to live, so that's why it doesn't live in lighted places, so like it doesn't dry up or something.
Teacher_FUNGI : So it's one of the conditions. Okay.
Teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, James?
Student_FUNGI : Well they probably eat the host, because if the size decreases, it might be the fungus eating it.
Teacher_FUNGI : It must be eating it. So if you're looking at the picture of the orange with fungus all over it, is it growing on it because of moisture? Is it growing on it because it's doing something else? What do you guys think about that?
Teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Kevin?
Student_FUNGI : Well, first of all, maybe the orange is in a dark place, and that in turn helps the orange to grow.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so it just needs the moisture that's on there, it'll live on anything that's moist, maybe?
Student_FUNGI : I'm thinking that the bacteria and fungus is always there, it's just microscopic so you can't see it, and if the food isn't eaten before it starts rotting, that's when the bacteria and the mold start feeding off of it and that's when it grows so we can see it.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so food has to get rotten first before mold grows on it. How many of you agree with that, food has to get rotten first before mold grows on it, or, food is rotten because mold grows on it. How many of you agree with the first statement? Raise your hands. How many of you agree with the second statement? So what's going on there?
Student_FUNGI : Maybe when maggots eat it, maybe like, when the maggots, their waste creates a mold, or a fungi? When there's mold there's fungi?
Teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying that the fungi are similar to the maggots that eat the...?
Student_FUNGI : Or maybe the waste creates the fungi, as it eats it.
Teacher_FUNGI : So the maggots eat the dead thing and it will create a fungus?
Student_FUNGI : I don't know, yeah.
Teacher_FUNGI : Maybe someone help me out. Ben?
Student_FUNGI : I don't think that they really eat the food, I think they suck out all the water, cause water mostly makes up a fruit's mass, so if it shrivels and loses most of its mass, that must mean that the water's getting out. And also, whenever I see fungi, it seems like it has a bunch of moisture around it, I'm wondering if it's because its water inside it is evaporated.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, you mean like if it's in a bag, and it has moisture in it? So we see it growing on places with water. And it needs moisture to grow.
Teacher_FUNGI : Let's talk about this idea more. If they're growing on places you thought, do you think they're getting anything out of that at all? Like rotten food. Would you eat rotten food? Do you think most living things would want to eat rotten food?
Student_FUNGI : No.
Teacher_FUNGI : So what is rotten food? What does that mean when we say it's "rotten"?
Student_FUNGI : It's kinda like expired, and like it's not good for you to eat because it makes you sick.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, but why is it not good for you to eat, though?
Student_FUNGI : But not all rotten is bad for you to eat, 'cause all cheese is rotten, because they make cheese with rotten milk, so not all rotten things are bad.
Student_FUNGI : Maybe it's decomposing, so maybe the nutrience in it, like the freshness and the combining nutrience are like turning bad?
Teacher_FUNGI : They're taking the stuff and turning it into...say that one more time.
Student_FUNGI : The nutrience that used to be good for you, now are like, since it's rotten basically, the goodness is gone, so it's just nothing, it makes you sick.
Teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying...the "goodness", what is goodness?
Student_FUNGI : It's the stuff like the nutrience that's good for you.
Teacher_FUNGI : Like what?
Student_FUNGI : Like the vitamins and everything?
Teacher_FUNGI : Like vitamins and what not. Okay so you're saying that fungi start off on fresh stuff, and then they break stuff down and take all the goodness away, is that what you're saying?
Teacher_FUNGI : I'm trying to see if I'm getting the right idea down.
Student_FUNGI : Yeah.
Teacher_FUNGI : Anyone want to add to that? Maybe I'm thinking differently to what Ollie is saying.
Student_FUNGI : I don't think they start out on fresh stuff, because I think when it starts to go bad, they form on it because I think they're attracted to food that goes bad. Cause, I dont' know, you dont' just buy a really fresh loaf of bread and then the next day fungus grows on it. It's like maybe after 2 weeks you see fungus growing on it.
Teacher_FUNGI : Where did it come from then? How did fungus get on things you seal completely? Any ideas?
Teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Ben?
Student_FUNGI : They probably travel through air or touch.
Teacher_FUNGI : Like what parts of them, they just like float through the air, so you're saying we've got fungus all around us right now, you think?
Student_FUNGI : Well, I don't know, maybe people inhale them and breathe them out?
Teacher_FUNGI : Travel through air.
Teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Grace.
Student_FUNGI : I think if you... when you touch it, and there's fungus or bacteria on your hands, then after a while it starts to add up.
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so once we like touch a type of... let's say you've got fungus on your hand or fungus is in the air, and it gets onto something, if it's so microscopic then how is it we can see it? We've got like the strawberries that had mold all over, the blackberries that are growing mold all around it, isn't it microscopic, though? how's it getting, why can we see it?
Teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Ian, what do you think?
Student_FUNGI : Like binary fission?
Teacher_FUNGI : Binary, what do you mean by that? Can you tell me what that is?
Student_FUNGI : Like cells keep constantly dividing, so it's not one cell, it's like a million cells each one from one original?
Teacher_FUNGI : Okay, so you're saying bacteria do binary fission, so are you saying they are multiplying?
Teacher_FUNGI : Yeah, Ollie.
Student_FUNGI : Since there's like lots and lots of bacteria like billions in this cubic centimeter there can't just be one to reproduce all of that. I bet like, since it's getting all its nutrience from the fruit, since it's being really healthy and all, it starts reproducing all of them, that's why it grows so much that we can see it.
Teacher_FUNGI : So you're saying there's a bunch of different types of fungus that's growing? Or it's just one individual that keeps growing?
Student_FUNGI : It's lots of types.
Teacher_FUNGI : Let's go back to this idea of, they grow on other things as a host, and it breaks things down. How might it break it down? Or how might it be similar to how we break things down? Any similarities you can think of?
Teacher_FUNGI : Patrick?
Student_FUNGI : Well like, our stomachs have acids that break things down, so maybe like the acids break things down?
Teacher_FUNGI : They use acids.
Student_FUNGI : But when Ben said when a fruit breaks things down it decomposes, so more nutrience comes out, so wouldn't it be better to eat rotten fruit than fresh fruit?
Teacher_FUNGI : Hmm, good question. Alex do you have an answer?
Student_FUNGI : I'm pretty sure that when something decomposes, the nutrience are leaving whatever is decomposing is going into the soil or whatever, so that's why we have composts.
Teacher_FUNGI : Like composts in what way?
Student_FUNGI : To help make...hmm.
Teacher_FUNGI : So that's something we can think about, so part of adding nutrience is maybe like composts? Claire?
Student_FUNGI : I think the nutrience for us is when it's not rotting and the nutrience for other things like gardens and stuff is when it is rotting, cause if you put like banana peels and things like that into a compost bin, it turns into dirt and has tons of nutrience and it's really good for growing things, so um, fungi could also help break down things like that. It does have nutrience for other things.
Teacher_FUNGI : Great, so maybe it's like compost and it provides things for other things, like dirt for nutrience?
Teacher_FUNGI : So we have a great start here. We've got so many ideas up here that are really great. Some of them kind of are different from one another or contradict one another, but we're going to start trying to figure out how these kind of connec tto one another, maybe figure out how do fungi decompose, how do they move, do they move at all? Do they grow in moist places? Why do they do some of these things? So we're gonna talk about that more during this unit. What questions do you have that maybe we can try to answer as we go along as well? Yesterday's homework I actually made you think of a couple questions, what questions do you have about fungi? Yeah, Ben?
Student_FUNGI : Can they rot still living things?
Teacher_FUNGI : Can they rot food?
Student_FUNGI : Like, rot still living things?
Teacher_FUNGI : Oh, okay. You're using rot like a verb? Can they rot living things.
Teacher_FUNGI : Any other questions? Ollie.
Student_FUNGI : If we eat a rotting fruit, is the fungi what makes us sick?
Teacher_FUNGI : Any other questions you have, yeah, Amy?
Student_FUNGI : How do fungi eat?
Teacher_FUNGI : How DO fungi eat?
Student_FUNGI : Why do fungi make that terrible smell?
Teacher_FUNGI : Do they all make that smell? Good question.
Student_FUNGI : How do they reproduce?
Teacher_FUNGI : How do they reproduce.
Teacher_FUNGI : Um, Yadi.
Student_FUNGI : How many parts do they have?
Teacher_FUNGI : How many parts do they have.
Teacher_FUNGI : That's real good.
Teacher_FUNGI : Um, Roxton and then Patrick.
Student_FUNGI : Is mushroom a fungi?
Teacher_FUNGI : Patrick?
Student_FUNGI : How does fungi acquire nutrience?
Teacher_FUNGI : How does it acquire nutrience.
Teacher_FUNGI : Any others?
Teacher_FUNGI : Kevin?
Student_FUNGI : Well, can it survive if it's like extreme heat?
Teacher_FUNGI : As we're going along, too, we'll add questions if we have more. This is a great place to start off.Teacher_ENERGY : Ok, so what we're going to do is we're going to turn these burners on pretty high and we're going to see what happens. So just like we always do, before we start I'm going to ask you to make a prediction about what you think will happen. And today is one of those days, if you saw a learnign target and ou wrote it down, that will be able to record and share my ideas. Today is one of those idea days where it does not matter what you write down so long as it's about this. Alright, so I'm not expecting you to know all the answers to all the questions I'm asking today, but I am expecting you to try to answer them. Ok? So do the best you can.
Student_ENERGY : [silence]
Teacher_ENERGY : This paper that I'm about to pass out will guide you through that process. The first thing I want you to do when you get this is fold it in half so that it looks like this. The only reason I'm asking you to do this is is that it makes it a little less overwhelming and it will help you focus on the ones that we're filling out.
Student_ENERGY : [silence]
Teacher_ENERGY : I need this row and this row right here to step up to these cabinets and that box and grap a pair of goggles and safety glasses. Make sure that they're comfortable and they fit your face.
Student_ENERGY : [silence]
Teacher_ENERGY : We have got on the very very top line it says zero minutes soda is frozen. So the 7-Up, I turned it up a little too high, it's actually not frozen anymore, but I want you to draw in that picture where the level of the soda is. I want you to use zoom-in circles to draw what the molecules of anything here that you want to draw. So you might draw, for example, the frozen coke in the flask. You might draw the air in the empty glass. You might draw the cold ice water or the ice inside of that bottle that's keeping it cold. You might draw the glass, a zoom-in of the glass. You decide. Then I'm asking you to predict what will happen with the soda. So you're just telling me what you think will happen. You got a little bit of a preview there, so you might have an idea.
Student_ENERGY : [silence]
Teacher_ENERGY : The soda begins to melt. So if you look at the Coke, there is some liquid Coke and some frozen Coke. It's like an iceburg. So I want you to think, how could now draw a zoom-in of that liquid that's melting in there.
Student_ENERGY : [silence]
Teacher_ENERGY : It happened again! But I just put it back, why is that happening?
Student_ENERGY : Because gas.
Teacher_ENERGY : So, Luke just told us we have switched already for the 7-Up, it's already boiling. So it's already- I'm going to turn it down just a little bit.
Student_ENERGY : [silence]
Teacher_ENERGY : What is happening here?
Student_ENERGY : There's no more gas.
Teacher_ENERGY : What do you see?
Student_ENERGY : Air.
Teacher_ENERGY : Maybe you draw a zoom-in and it shows the steam. What would those molecules look like? Make sure you label all your zoom-ins.
Student_ENERGY : [silence]
Teacher_ENERGY : Ok, hey! Something else just happened. That just went past my arm and it's hot. So that's something else that happened, that's information that I was hoping to get.
Student_ENERGY : [silence]
Teacher_ENERGY : Ok, so I'm going to ask a really good question. Let me ask, what happens if you take it off, will it still boil? Look it's still boiling. Why do you think that is?
Student_ENERGY : Those are big molecules.
Teacher_ENERGY : I heard carbonation. I heard molecules. What is your explanation? Zoom-in on those bubbles maybe or write it in.
Teacher_ENERGY : Draw a zoom-in symbol there. See how David's drawing the level of the soda in? When it's frozen? So now I want you to draw a zoom-in circle that shows what the molecules would look like if you zoom way way in. That's fine. Just draw a little point. Show where you're drawing it to and from and show what these molecules look like, so what's the movement like? How are they arranged? How much space between them?
Student_ENERGY : Like this?
Teacher_ENERGY : Yes.
Teacher_ENERGY : So somebody just shared an idea with me. They said, they're talking about the steam so they said the reason something's going through this tube is the steam is pushing it up so it doesn't have anywhere else to go. And I said, ok, so what's going to happen when the steam gets to the cold flask? ok? May I share your idea? So Alicia said, because she thinks it's going to be water again. So it's going to look like water.Teacher_ENERGY : So, if I take this here, and I add it to this glass, how much do you think we're going to have?
Student_ENERGY : Seventy percent
Teacher_ENERGY : So, some people are saying we'll have the same amount we started with, some people say we're going to have more than we started with. So I want to hear from the people who said we're going to have the same amount first. Why would we have the same amount that we started with?
Student_ENERGY : Just threw that out there
Teacher_ENERGY : Ok, so a guess. Anyone have a reason and not just a guess? Alisha?
Student_ENERGY : Because the tube is connected from that glass to that glass so there would have to be the same amount.
Teacher_ENERGY : So you're saying that the connection between the two flasks means that nothing could ever get out? That's why you're saying it's the same amount? It's going from one to the other?
Teacher_ENERGY : Ok. Anyone want to argue for the more? Why we have more than we started with? And David, are you willing to tell everyone why you think there would actually be less? Do you have a reason?
Student_ENERGY : I said there's less because not all of the Coke is gone, there's some left.
Teacher_ENERGY : So explain your thinking a little more. You're saying there's some left in here?
Student_ENERGY : It's transferring to the second bottle, but it didn't all get there because there is some left in the first.
Teacher_ENERGY : So, if I recombine it, shouldn't it be the same amount? Or not?
Student_ENERGY : I guess.
Teacher_ENERGY : Well, what do you think? Why wouldn't it be the same amount? Where would it have gone?
Student_ENERGY : Because some of it is air.
Teacher_ENERGY : How is it air? We got it all closed up.
Student_ENERGY : It popped off.
Teacher_ENERGY : Oh, it popped off. Ok. You got your hand up.
Student_ENERGY : I think it's going to be less.
Teacher_ENERGY : You think it's going to be less. Any reason?
Teacher_ENERGY : Alright, let's see what happens. So where's 75 on there? This is 75. So we have just over 50 milliliters. So we have less. Ok? So now we know what the answer is. We have less. So why do we have less? I have heard from people that it should be the same because all that happened is something moved from one flask to the other one. But then Alano said that's not what happened because I saw it pop off and it went into the air. How did it go into the air?
Student_ENERGY : The soda was evaporating and then went on to the other one, and so when it popped up it threw away most of the evaporated stuff going through the tube, and that made it like condense.
Teacher_ENERGY : Ok, this is the second time, Raul, that I heard you use the word throw to describe how the steam is moving, or how the gas is moving. You said it got thrown away.
Student_ENERGY : It shot out, with the gas.
Teacher_ENERGY : So, you're talking about the suddeness of it?
Student_ENERGY : You know how the tube, it popped up? Then the steam just shot away, and then you have less.
Teacher_ENERGY : So, there's something going on with the steam and everything that's happening here? Alright. So I want you to look up at our learning target: I will be able to record and share my ideas. Right now, if you look at your paper, you should be able to say, yes I have recorded all my ideas. All those spaces should be filled. There should be zoom-ins and drawings.Teacher_MATH : what I need for you to do right now is, every one of you get out a blank sheet of paper.
Student_MATH : ashley, can I have a piece of paper?
Teacher_MATH : just put it right on the table back there.
Student_MATH : thank you.
Teacher_MATH : thank you Sarah.
Teacher_MATH : don't leave without it, all right.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : listen closely now. everybody ready?
Student_MATH : yep.
Teacher_MATH : can someone raise their hand and tell me what's one obvious thing that I can do to graph? nick?
Student_MATH : the slope.
Teacher_MATH : use the slope with the?
Student_MATH : y intercept and X intercept.
Teacher_MATH : y intercept. that's probably the way you'll probably want to do it, right Nick?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : is there another way, though? Robert?
Student_MATH : use the, um, tables.
Teacher_MATH : right, to make a table for the equation, right? and then plot the points from the table. so go ahead and get started.
Teacher_MATH : Nick, question?
Student_MATH : where's this...oh, right here?
Teacher_MATH : yeah. you're going to graph on that. that is your result for your group.
Student_MATH : so everybody has to do one graph, right?
Teacher_MATH : right.
Teacher_MATH : so while he's doing that, let's get started on this, guys. what are we going to do?
Student_MATH : do we write this on our piece of paper?
Teacher_MATH : yeah.
Student_MATH : oh, okay.
Teacher_MATH : all right? 
Student_MATH : Mister Ormsby, you know, when you put, like, a one in here, would you go like, times plus...
Teacher_MATH : ah, see, so now you've already forgotten, right? first of all, zeros are our favorite number, right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : you put in zero. two thirds times zero is what?
Student_MATH : zero.
Teacher_MATH : plus eight is?
Student_MATH : eight.
Teacher_MATH : eight.
Teacher_MATH : now because this fraction is a two thirds, do you remember what I told you what numbers you should pick now?
Student_MATH : um, threes.
Teacher_MATH : all right. so maybe zero, three and six would be good numbers to try with this one, right? that way you don't have to worry about fractions and mixed numbers.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Teacher_MATH : all right.
Student_MATH : Mister, I forgot how to do these again. Like how do you do X and Y?
Teacher_MATH : okay, so now wait a minute. you want to make a table then, right? the idea again is, to make our points we just pick any number we want for x. We can do that, right? Jenna?
Student_MATH : yeah. so it was zero, one, and two
Teacher_MATH : ah, that's true, except because this is a two thirds fraction +...
Student_MATH : you want to pick three as like +/.
Teacher_MATH : exactly.
Student_MATH : negative three, zero and three.
Teacher_MATH : right, and if you want to just do zero, three, six and stay away from negatives, you can do that too.
Teacher_MATH : all right?
Student_MATH : I got six in the middle. so, zero, three, six.
Teacher_MATH : right.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : and you think you can do it on your own now?
Teacher_MATH : you just want to be on the camera.
Student_MATH : no, that's not true.
Teacher_MATH : okay, we're going to put in zero here, right?
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : what's two thirds times zero?
Student_MATH : zero.
Teacher_MATH : everybody watching, right? plus eight is?
Student_MATH : eight.
Teacher_MATH : eight.
Student_MATH : so three times two is...
Teacher_MATH : six.
Student_MATH : divided by three is two.
Teacher_MATH : three is two.
Student_MATH : plus eight is...
Teacher_MATH : eight is?
Student_MATH : ten. okay I get it. thank you Mister Ormsby.
Teacher_MATH : okay. good job.
Student_MATH : all right, so, okay, this is what I did. I put three negative three, zero, three and six, all right?
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : how come you have your table backwards? I've never done that before.
Student_MATH : well, I did that.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Student_MATH : it's easier this way.
Teacher_MATH : all right, if you say so.
Student_MATH : anyways, I put negative three, so, I put two thirds and then that.
Teacher_MATH : times negative three.
Student_MATH : yeah. negative three goes in the top, right?
Teacher_MATH : right. well, negative three, you remember, is negative three over one.
Teacher_MATH : there you go.
Student_MATH : so it's a one and a one. but that's a negative still, right?
Teacher_MATH : right. that's still a negative there.
Student_MATH : so it's negative two?
Teacher_MATH : plus eight is?
Student_MATH : six.
Teacher_MATH : yeah.
Student_MATH : see, I knew that.
Teacher_MATH : so negative three is six, zero is eight. now, try a positive three.
Student_MATH : cause they're both positive so... two third so, three, one and...oh.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Student_MATH : one one, and then three, eight, eleven.
Teacher_MATH : no, wait a minute.
Student_MATH : two... one is... and five.
Teacher_MATH : two plus... wait a minute, no, you were timesing it.
Student_MATH : oh. it's ten.
Teacher_MATH : it's ten.
Teacher_MATH : and then six is twelve.
Student_MATH : it's six then ten and twelve.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : yes?
Student_MATH : all right, I just totally forgot um, you know, how to do the graph.
Teacher_MATH : okay, now what I liked how you at least remember to use multiples. 
Teacher_MATH : like this one, let's try this one right here. All right?
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : you remembered to use fives, but let's try zero. if I put in zero there, what's three fifths times zero?
Student_MATH : um... zero?
Teacher_MATH : right. minus ten?
Student_MATH : is negative ten?
Teacher_MATH : so put a negative ten there.
Teacher_MATH : so now you're going to try five in there, right?
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : so just write a little five there so you can mentally see it. so if I do three times five that's?
Student_MATH : fifteen.
Teacher_MATH : now remember I'm going to divide by the five, which gives me?
Student_MATH : three.
Teacher_MATH : minus ten.
Student_MATH : negative seven.
Teacher_MATH : good job.
Teacher_MATH : I think you got it now.
Student_MATH : oh, okay.
Teacher_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : finish it up.
Student_MATH : Mister Ormsby?
Teacher_MATH : all right.
Student_MATH : uh, how many points do you want us to plot? three or four?
Teacher_MATH : well that's a very good question. obviously, how many points do I really need to make a line?
Student_MATH : two.
Teacher_MATH : two.
Teacher_MATH : right? but just to make sure...
Student_MATH : three.
Teacher_MATH : plot at least three points.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : that way if they're all in a line you know you did it right.
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Student_MATH : Mister Ormsby.
Teacher_MATH : yeah?
Student_MATH : I made the graph.
Teacher_MATH : use the whole paper, man.
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Student_MATH : don't we have to graph every single one of those?
Teacher_MATH : yeah, you're going to graph these five. that's why I want you to use the whole paper. make a big coordinate system.
Student_MATH : oh.
Teacher_MATH : as a matter of fact, let me give you a fresh one to save you some time.
Student_MATH : oh, okay. all right, now I get it.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : use the whole coordinate system, that way all the lines are nicely spaced out and everything.
Student_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Student_MATH : we're out of space.
Teacher_MATH : okay, well how do you want to graph it? using an x y table?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : or do you want to learn how to use slope and y intercept?
Student_MATH : x and y table.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : see, if you work with Chris side by side, then you can compare answers. right?
Student_MATH : mm hm.
Teacher_MATH : don't just rely on Chris here.
Teacher_MATH : The idea is I'm gonna plug in any values I really want for x and figure out my corresponding y. But because this fraction is a two thirds, what numbers should I possibly use that would make it easier for me?
Student_MATH : three.
Teacher_MATH : numbers based on three. or zero, three, six, would be good enough, right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : that way you can get that graph down. okay?Teacher_MATH : so, you need my help, or do you want to try it on your own first?
Student_MATH : to input this, do I have to put this number?
Teacher_MATH : all right, you ready?
Teacher_MATH : well, if you want, we don't have to do the negative.
Teacher_MATH : you want to do the negative?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : okay, here we go.
Teacher_MATH : put a little negative three above there.
Teacher_MATH : now you know I'm going to do two times negative three, which is?
Student_MATH : negative six.
Teacher_MATH : divide by three is?
Student_MATH : negative two.
Teacher_MATH : good. plus eight.
Student_MATH : six.
Teacher_MATH : positive six.
Student_MATH : oh.
Teacher_MATH : now you're going to put in a zero and do the same thing, right?
Teacher_MATH : ben, see what Chris did there.
Student_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : all right sir, it looks like you're being left out here, aren't you?
Student_MATH : no.
Teacher_MATH : okay, you understand what they're doing?
Student_MATH : we're using slope.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : so all right, let me ... let me test you here. let's try number four. all right?
Student_MATH : okay, number four.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : oh by the way guys, I like how you labeled them, like that.
Student_MATH : thanks.
Teacher_MATH : excellent job.
Teacher_MATH : x minus nine, right?
Student_MATH : minus nine, okay.
Teacher_MATH : so tell me how you would graph that?
Student_MATH : I would graph it like this.
Teacher_MATH : here we go.
Student_MATH : I would go negative nine. so, one, two, three, four, five.
Teacher_MATH : now that's negative nine for that.
Student_MATH : uh huh.
Teacher_MATH : right?
Student_MATH : mm hm.
Teacher_MATH : that negative nine really is my y intercept.
Student_MATH : so then I go down.
Teacher_MATH : ah ha.
Student_MATH : one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Teacher_MATH : good.
Teacher_MATH : and now my slope is one fourth.
Student_MATH : uh huh.
Teacher_MATH : so that means?
Student_MATH : one, one, two, three, four.
Teacher_MATH : good job.
Student_MATH : This times two is six. negative six. all right this is seven, ten, and sixteen this time.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Student_MATH : is this right?
Teacher_MATH : what's your question, Brandon?
Student_MATH : I don't even know how to do this. I don't get it.
Teacher_MATH : what about your partner here? she's doing an excellent job here.
Student_MATH : oh.
Teacher_MATH : what, are you shy or something?
Student_MATH : no, I just asked this guy and he said something else. I'm trying to figure this one out. how do you do this?
Teacher_MATH : okay, let me go to this other group, guys. and if they can't do it, I'll be back in a few minutes to help you. all right?
Student_MATH : Mister Ormsby, this is like the same thing as I did that one, right?
Teacher_MATH : okay. let's take a look here.
Student_MATH : I mean, I know how to do this, but I don't know how to do the fractions.
Teacher_MATH : I mean, a lot of these tables look great, now let's get them plotted here.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : and we can see what it comes out to be.
Student_MATH : so after we write them all down, we plot them on here?
Teacher_MATH : right.
Student_MATH : every single one?
Teacher_MATH : right. and then you're going to label them.
Teacher_MATH : now if you +...if you don't mind, since this is equation one, just put a little one at the end of it. and equation two put a two at it [//] at the end of it. okay?
Student_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : brandon, you had a comment? question?
Student_MATH : I know how to do the regular ones but I don't know how to do the one with fractions. those are the ones that I have trouble with.
Teacher_MATH : well, okay. well maybe you ought to go to Nick. sounds like Nick knows what he's doing.
Student_MATH : no, I said that I have trouble on it.
Teacher_MATH : okay, then maybe we ought to go to Ashley.
Teacher_MATH : what do we got going on here?
Student_MATH : we're done.
Teacher_MATH : sir?
Student_MATH : well, we got done with all of those. we were going to call you but you were talking to them.
Teacher_MATH : trying to embarrass me here or something?
Student_MATH : of course not.
Teacher_MATH : uh huh.
Student_MATH : you're really slow. for these ones here +...
Teacher_MATH : you're such a character, Nick.
Student_MATH : for these, for the fractions we did the slope and then we made a table, and we're done.
Teacher_MATH : and everybody here agrees, right?
Student_MATH : uh huh.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : this one you didn't number. what number is that one?
Student_MATH : uh, I think that was five.
Teacher_MATH : that was five. that one's correct, so put a five there.
Teacher_MATH : okay, I can safely assume that this one must be the four, right?
Student_MATH : that was five.
Teacher_MATH : or is this one the four? which one's the four?
Student_MATH : this one's two.
Teacher_MATH : which one's two?
Student_MATH : four is negative nine, and up one is four.
Teacher_MATH : are you sure about that?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : because this one is different
Student_MATH : one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. oh no. this is four.
Teacher_MATH : ah. right.
Student_MATH : this one's two.
Teacher_MATH : so do me a favor. erase the two, right, and label them right near the ends of the lines. because right there I can't tell which line you're talking about, right?
Student_MATH : right.
Teacher_MATH : put the four right there. okay? so both of those look excellent.
Student_MATH : six minus five.
Teacher_MATH : number one, slope with two thirds starting at eight and this one is seven, right?
Student_MATH : mm hm.
Teacher_MATH : uh oh. I don't like equation three because look, it's going down. that's a positive three.
Student_MATH : oh.
Teacher_MATH : it should be going...
Student_MATH : up.
Teacher_MATH : it should be angling up.
Teacher_MATH : I'll check that one later. okay?
Student_MATH : Mister Ormsby?
Teacher_MATH : here we go. yeah?
Student_MATH : we don't get number five.
Teacher_MATH : number five. all right, first of all, you know the y intercept is what?
Student_MATH : negative five.
Teacher_MATH : all right. so put a dot on negative five.
Student_MATH : one, two, three, four, five.
Teacher_MATH : good. we all agree on that?
Student_MATH : yes.
Teacher_MATH : now, this is something so simple but very important. see in Algebra we get lazy sometimes, right? guess what number is in front of that.
Student_MATH : one.
Teacher_MATH : a one, right? if the slope is one, what am I going to do? how do I make one a fraction?
Student_MATH : one over one.
Teacher_MATH : all right, that's fine.
Teacher_MATH : now remember slope is rise over one, right?
Student_MATH : mm hm.
Teacher_MATH : so one over one means I rise one and I go across one.
Student_MATH : there.
Teacher_MATH : that's it. that's the slope of one.
Teacher_MATH : and this one's equation three, right? so put a three next to that.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : so number them, in other words, okay?
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : because what that's going to do, that's going to help you when I ask these questions about each of the equations.
Teacher_MATH : so as soon as you get that done, which you're almost done, you get them numbered, just move on to the next set of five.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : all right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : all right.
Student_MATH : so this is three fifths, negative ten?
Teacher_MATH : okay. so wait a minute. you're doing negative five, right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : three times negative five is negative fifteen.
Student_MATH : negative fifteen.
Teacher_MATH : divided by five. negative three. minus ten?
Student_MATH : is, um, negative, um, seven... oh, minus ten?
Teacher_MATH : negative three and a negative ten.
Student_MATH : oh, um, thirteen.
Teacher_MATH : negative thirteen. so let's change that.
Student_MATH : mm hm.
Teacher_MATH : well negative five is going to be, not five, but negative?
Student_MATH : thirteen.
Teacher_MATH : thirteen.
Teacher_MATH : get some help from them.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : you think you got it? if I put in zero here what am I going to get?
Student_MATH : uh, zero.
Teacher_MATH : wait a minute, what's three fifths times zero?
Student_MATH : three fifths times zero?
Teacher_MATH : zero. minus ten would be?
Student_MATH : ten.
Teacher_MATH : zero minus ten would be?
Student_MATH : ten.
Teacher_MATH : not positive ten.
Student_MATH : negative ten.
Teacher_MATH : negative ten. so you want to put a negative ten there. okay?
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : now try at least one more of five. okay?
Student_MATH : uh, Isn't that, uh...
Teacher_MATH : now it's a positive five.Teacher_MATH : right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : so it's going to be... well, what's three times a positive five? fifteen.
Student_MATH : yeah, fifteen.
Teacher_MATH : divided by five is?
Student_MATH : three.
Teacher_MATH : three minus ten.
Student_MATH : seven.
Teacher_MATH : negative seven. don't forget the negative.
Student_MATH : negative seven. oh, all right.
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Teacher_MATH : all right guys. thanks for waiting so long.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : all right, you want me to just check the answers?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : now the only favor I need you to do, is because for each of these numbered equations, just number them. for example, this is one, correct?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : this one was equation three.
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : this one was equation five. so near the end of each of these arrows +...
Student_MATH : yeah, put the number?
Teacher_MATH : just put ... put the number. and then this one, let me just make sure, because I don't have them all memorized.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : let's see, negative nine was one fourth. you've got the slope perfect there and this one was three fifths, right?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : so everything looks perfect.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : just number them and move on to the next five.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Student_MATH : Mister Ormsby? we're on number six. I got it, guys. check our answers. so here's all of number five.
Teacher_MATH : look at that excellent work, man.
Teacher_MATH : excellent work.
Student_MATH : I crossed it out. there's one, there's two, there's three, and there's four and there's five. I figured it out.
Teacher_MATH : excellent.
Student_MATH : but it... they're having problems on number... oh there it is. I found it.
Teacher_MATH : okay. you know what? as a matter of fact I think it's time for me to address the whole class.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : everybody. ladies and gentlemen, listen up. 
Student_MATH : (chattering)
Teacher_MATH : five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : now, about half of you are about ready to start the next set of five, right? starting on number six?
Student_MATH : yep, that's what we're doing. we're starting...
Teacher_MATH : let me give you a hint. just a little reminder, what you will notice...
Student_MATH : (chattering)
Teacher_MATH : julie, you're doing a great job but please listen, okay? you'll notice on equations six through ten the slopes are negative.
Student_MATH : yep, all xxx.
Teacher_MATH : all right?
Teacher_MATH : so therefore, instead of rise over run meaning you'd go up and to the right, with the negative you're going to instead go, down and to the right.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : okay? does that make sense to everybody?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : so please keep going. please make sure I check your first five and give you the okay to move on.
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Student_MATH : all right. could you check ours?
Teacher_MATH : yeah.
Student_MATH : actually, I'm on four.
Teacher_MATH : I'll check yours real quick. 
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : okay. all right, good. you guys numbered them?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : there's one, slope. equation three, two thirds.
Teacher_MATH : equation five looks good.
Student_MATH : I haven't even gotten to five. I'm already...
Teacher_MATH : okay. then you've got four and two.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : it looks perfect so far.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : move on to equation six then.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : now you're saying you're being left behind here a little bit? on which one?
Student_MATH : well, they're obviously on five and +...
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Student_MATH : we're on...
Teacher_MATH : now Robert, here, I'm sure can help you. you've got one of the smartest kids in class right here.
Student_MATH : he's tried to explain it once, but I'm not so sure.
Teacher_MATH : okay. it looks like you made a nice table here, though. you understand what you did there?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : okay. so when you put in zero, one fourth times zero is what?
Student_MATH : zero.
Teacher_MATH : minus nine is?
Student_MATH : negative nine.
Teacher_MATH : okay. then you tried four, right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : all right. why did you pick four and eight? why didn't you pick like one and two and three? numbers like that?
Student_MATH : because they're divisible by four.
Teacher_MATH : well said. good job.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : so when I try four, see, what's one fourth times four? just one +...
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : minus nine is a negative eight.
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : and then you put an eight. one fourth of eight is?
Student_MATH : two.
Teacher_MATH : minus nine is negative seven. so that's perfect.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : if you plot those three points you get exactly what is on your graph there. okay?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : alright
Student_MATH : can I see this really quick? Mister Ormsby?
Teacher_MATH : guys...
Student_MATH : are you sure this is right? because you're all...
Teacher_MATH : oh, so you want me to just check six real quick, right?
Student_MATH : and five. five, because that's the one we messed up on.
Teacher_MATH : right. five now looks perfect.
Student_MATH : no three. three was...
Teacher_MATH : oh, three was the one we messed up on. 
Student_MATH : yeah
Teacher_MATH : so three is right here and the idea is that you want a positive three slope, which you did perfectly.
Student_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : so three is good.
Teacher_MATH : let's go back to six... since we're here. here's six, so you started at positive eight.
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : the slope is negative five thirds so you went down five and over three, didn't you?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : perfect.
Student_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : Ashley, how is Brandon doing here? Brandon?
Student_MATH : I'm helping him. 
Teacher_MATH : Good.
Student_MATH : I'm helping
Teacher_MATH : that's what I want to see.
Student_MATH : the rest... we're done. we just want you to check.
Teacher_MATH : all right, you keep helping Brandon.
Teacher_MATH : let me meet with Ashley over here. Nick, if you want to watch you can.
Student_MATH : okey dokey.
Teacher_MATH : but I can tell you right now, five is good.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : okay? let me start in order here. one looks good.
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : hold it. wait a minute. let me check one again. one, the slope is two thirds, isn't it? 
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : right?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : so first of all our y-intercept is eight.
Student_MATH : wait, wait.
Teacher_MATH : Ashley, let's look at yours since you're more comfortable with yours.
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : you agree that zero, eight should be my first point, right?
Student_MATH : mm hm.
Teacher_MATH : two, four, six, eight. okay. that's good. three...
Student_MATH : I made one over three. one, two, three.
Teacher_MATH : oh, here's your mistake. all right? now watch Ashley, you ready?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : when I put in three, two times the three would be six...
Student_MATH : six. oh yeah.
Teacher_MATH : divided by three would make?
Student_MATH : two.
Teacher_MATH : two. six divided by three is two, right?
Student_MATH : I know it's two.
Teacher_MATH : okay, plus eight would make, ten. so three would be ten; well what's two plus eight?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : ten. so if that's a ten, this one I'm sure has got to be something bigger. okay?
Student_MATH : eleven. twelve? this may be twelve.
Teacher_MATH : I believe it's twelve.
Student_MATH : yeah, see I did it on here, but I did it wrong on my paper.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Student_MATH : it's weird.
Teacher_MATH : all right, so it sounds like you guys didn't compare your answers here.
Student_MATH : m-hm.
Teacher_MATH : But I think that's your only mistake. because equation three looks very good. all right.
Teacher_MATH : you know what? equation two I don't necessarily like either. is this supposed to be two?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : two says we're starting at what number?
Student_MATH : negative ten.
Teacher_MATH : negative ten, right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : you're not starting at negative ten here. what's this number? two, four... somehow you're starting at negative six. so what happened on equation two, guys?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : hey, how come we didn't use your table?
Student_MATH : I don't know. we were looking at his. so if we start at ten, then...
Teacher_MATH : oh, I know, look what you did wrong. you copied the equation down wrong.
Student_MATH : that's number four.
Teacher_MATH : oh, I'm sorry. you're right. my mistake.
Student_MATH : oh yeah, it does start at six.
Teacher_MATH : I can't even read your writing.
Teacher_MATH : yeah, why is that a six? that should be a negative ten, right?
Student_MATH : it looks like a six but it's ten.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : and five you got negative seven.
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : I agree with that.
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : okay, and then ten you got negative four. okay, so why don't you try replotting those three points and move on to equation six through ten and I'll check on number two later on.
Student_MATH : alright.
Teacher_MATH : okay, the rest of them look pretty good, though. alright?
Student_MATH : Mister Ormsby, whoo hoo.
Teacher_MATH : okay, what are we doing here, guys?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : hey, how come none of these lines are labeled?
Student_MATH : whoops.
Teacher_MATH : now what I suggest you do +...
Student_MATH : xxx two lines.
Teacher_MATH : hold on. what I suggest you do before I come back is for each of these [//] just call it equation one, two, three, four, and five, right?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : put a number at the end of each of these lines.
Student_MATH : oh, like number one, two, three +...
Teacher_MATH : like for example, number one... uh oh. wait a minute.
Student_MATH : look what you made me do.
Teacher_MATH : I don't like what I see here.
Student_MATH : you probably thought of it wrong.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : let's see here. number one, I believe this is supposed to be your number one here, right?
Student_MATH : I think so. I don't know.
Teacher_MATH : how come it's going down, guys?
Student_MATH : I don't know, it does it.
Teacher_MATH : aren't all these slopes positive? so all of these should be going up.
Student_MATH : how's it going down?
Teacher_MATH : look at it. it's going down.
Student_MATH : it's going up.
Teacher_MATH : how do you read a book? how do you read a book, sir?
Student_MATH : left to right.
Teacher_MATH : you read from left to right. so let's start on the left side of the line.
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : and as I move to the right I'm going in which direction?
Student_MATH : down.
Teacher_MATH : right. now if you look at all the other lines, see they're all positive.
Student_MATH : but it's going up.
Teacher_MATH : sir you have to read from left to right. okay?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : all right.
Student_MATH : it's going down like that.
Teacher_MATH : so, guys, you need to make those corrections. label the line.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : correct this one, at least.
Student_MATH : how come we've never done this before?
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Student_MATH : you made me do it... could you check our answers for...
Teacher_MATH : oh my gosh. let me make sure I keep track of the time, too. all right.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : hey you guys did an awesome job here.
Teacher_MATH : okay. let's take a look here. so here's your number six right?
Student_MATH : uh huh.
Teacher_MATH : and you started at eight and the slope was negative five thirds so you went down five and over three.
Student_MATH : uh huh.
Teacher_MATH : that line looks perfect. let's look at your number seven. here's negative one. you went down four and over one.
Student_MATH : m-hm.
Teacher_MATH : there's your line there. that looks perfect.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : let's check number eight real quick.
Student_MATH : all right, I think I did it kinda +...
Teacher_MATH : oh, that's the eight, right? okay? so on number eight you started at twelve and negative one third. looks perfect.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : number nine is fourteen, which is where?
Student_MATH : it's all the way up here.
Teacher_MATH : way at the very top. and negative three halves means you went down three.Teacher_MATH : and over two, so there's your line right there.
Teacher_MATH : and finally number ten, we're at three, the slope is negative one. perfect.
Student_MATH : cool.
Teacher_MATH : so now, all you guys have to do +...
Student_MATH : answer the questions.
Teacher_MATH : is to answer these questions. okay?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : the best you can.
Student_MATH : on this piece of paper?
Teacher_MATH : on your piece of paper.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : on your own piece of paper okay?
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : all right, how we doing here, guys?
Student_MATH : I don't know...
Teacher_MATH : what's the ruler for?
Student_MATH : oh.
Teacher_MATH : look at this. just from now on make sure to straighten out these lines and keep going.
Student_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : and are you labeling? that's number one...
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : number two.
Student_MATH : no that's number three. I forgot to do number two.
Teacher_MATH : okay, wait a minute. number three is concerning me. you ready?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : let's try this again real quick. all right. it's three plus seven, right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : so when I put in... let's just start with zero. when I put in zero, what's three times zero?
Student_MATH : zero.
Teacher_MATH : plus seven is?
Student_MATH : seven.
Teacher_MATH : why did you put negative seven?
Teacher_MATH : what's zero plus seven?
Student_MATH : well I started [//] oh.
Teacher_MATH : Chris, let me take a look at your table for three. how come you're not standing up to Raymond here and saying, hey man, look I got the right answers.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : all right, your table is correct. you've got to believe in yourself. all right?
Student_MATH : I didn't know it was right.
Teacher_MATH : you guys gotta start working better together and comparing answers.
Teacher_MATH : all right?
Teacher_MATH : Ben, I'm worried about you man. what are we doing here.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : put away the book.
Student_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : and Chris, you need to work with your normal partner here a little bit better. and compare answers.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : so I mean, if you would have compared answers, guys, you would have seen on this table here, right +...
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : that, hey! someone must be making a mistake because we're getting different answers here, right?
Student_MATH : mm hm.
Teacher_MATH : so, either correct yours, or if you want, you can trust Chris. I would trust Chris' to be honest.
Student_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Student_MATH : I used twos... three...
Teacher_MATH : right. now did you have to go by twos?
Student_MATH : I don't. Did I?
Teacher_MATH : Wait a minute, isn't this just a regular number three?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : so on these kind, I always told you just use, like, zero, one and two, right? you didn't have to go by multiples or anything because there's no fraction to divide by. you see?
Teacher_MATH : all right guys, let's see what we can do here.
Student_MATH : Mister Ormsby? all right, never mind.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : can I interrupt the whole class?
Student_MATH : (chattering)
Teacher_MATH : shh. okay.
Student_MATH : I guess.
Teacher_MATH : five, four, three, two, one, zero. shh. now please listen.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : okay?
Teacher_MATH : the thing is I have to be honest. I'm getting a little worried, maybe a little frustrated here, just because I could see that some of you have some serious weaknesses. yet, you have people either across from you or right next to you, your own partner that seems most of the time. have the right answers, yet you're not even asking them. so, guys, I ask you, starting right now, is check your work with your partner's work. work together. all right, this is not an individual kind of assignment here. does everything I say make sense so far?
Student_MATH : yes Mister Ormsby.
Teacher_MATH : okay. now let me just give you a heads up. we've got roughly what? twelve minutes left in class?
Student_MATH : um, xxx.
Teacher_MATH : okay. I want you to keep doing what you're doing. if for whatever reason you actually get to the last page...
Student_MATH : yeah, we are at there.
Teacher_MATH : and you've answered these questions to the best of your ability. now obviously today we have no time to discuss it, okay. we're going to pick this up again on Monday, but if you happen to ask these questions...
Student_MATH : monday?
Teacher_MATH : yeah, we're back on Monday, right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : when we... after you answer these questions, if you get that far, please make sure you do this quickwrite. all right. which simply means all I want you to do is be honest with yourself and with me and just sit there for the remaining time. write a minimum of two paragraphs, okay, on what we've learned today. what you've actually learned today. okay?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : those of you that aren't at this stage, don't worry about it yet. at about, let's say, four or five minutes, I'm going to make all of you do it anyways.
Student_MATH : you're so generous, Mister Ormsby.
Teacher_MATH : so please keep working wherever you are. I'm still walking around. 
Teacher_MATH : yeah?
Student_MATH : I didn't do...
Teacher_MATH : don't worry about that until Monday.
Student_MATH : (chattering)
Teacher_MATH : we'll catch up on Monday. all right? let's focus on this.
Student_MATH : we got done and we... like right there.
Teacher_MATH : all right, Ashley?
Student_MATH : yeah, um... okay, I don't get these two.
Teacher_MATH : all right. does anyone in this group...
Student_MATH : no.
Teacher_MATH : understand what to do here?
Student_MATH : no. because, like, there's different numbers. which one would we use?
Teacher_MATH : okay. all right.
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : okay. now you want to use slope and y-intercept or do you want to make tables?
Student_MATH : tables.
Teacher_MATH : seems like tables are the way to go here, right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : so let's go there, all right?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : first of all, Ashley, that's a negative five thirds, isn't it?
Student_MATH : oh. wait, no, the fastest...
Teacher_MATH : okay. so now, if I plug in zero, guys, Brandon, watch. if I plug in zero, what's negative five thirds times zero?
Student_MATH : zero.
Teacher_MATH : plus eight is?
Student_MATH : eight.
Teacher_MATH : all right. that was easy.
Student_MATH : but I don't know what to use. like threes?
Teacher_MATH : you would use threes. try three and six. okay?
Student_MATH : my stomach's hurting. can I get a drink of water?
Teacher_MATH : sir, no. you have to stay here. all right?
Teacher_MATH : so all right, let's try three. Nick, Jessie, you ready?
Student_MATH : two, ten.
Teacher_MATH : if I put in a three there, okay...
Student_MATH : it's going to be five, right?
Teacher_MATH : you're going to get negative five because the negative plus eight. what's negative five plus eight?
Student_MATH : three. negative... oh yeah.
Teacher_MATH : positive three.
Student_MATH : wait... is negative two. wait, is that how you do three?
Teacher_MATH : well you wrote it upside down. that's okay. and then the next one is going to be what?
Student_MATH : negative two.
Teacher_MATH : it's going to be negative two. you got it.
Student_MATH : oh.
Teacher_MATH : ...two.
Student_MATH : oh no, I...
Teacher_MATH : okay, you did that in your head, huh?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : impressive.
Student_MATH : I always do my work in my head.
Teacher_MATH : okay. so don't let the negatives scare you. just the same idea as the front. just know that when you times, you've got to have a negative, right, in your problem. that's all.
Student_MATH : all right.
Teacher_MATH : why do you keep getting out of your seat, Robert?
Student_MATH : well, I have to xxx.
Teacher_MATH : I'm coming to... okay, I just kind of noticed out of the corner of my eye. so what's going on here, how we doing?
Student_MATH : okay.
Student_MATH : we're doing fine.
Teacher_MATH : okay? so have I come by to check all ten equations yet?
Student_MATH : no not yet, we're just... we're on number ten.
Teacher_MATH : okay. you are on number ten. you want me to wait until you get number ten done?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : okay. 
Teacher_MATH : all right.
Student_MATH : why did I get it wrong... oh, I didn't write it.
Teacher_MATH : ladies, you've been awful quiet over here. what's going on?
Student_MATH : well, because we've been waiting for you?
Teacher_MATH : okay, all right.
Student_MATH : for like a century.
Teacher_MATH : so where are you stuck? or if you're not stuck, what would like me... do you want me to just check your answers then?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : is that what you're saying?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : okay. so... so I've already checked the first five? yes or no?
Student_MATH : no.
Teacher_MATH : oh, really?
Student_MATH : well, because you've been over there, you know +...
Teacher_MATH : yeah, I know. I've been pretty busy.
Teacher_MATH : all right, let's start with six through ten.
Student_MATH : well, we're only on eight.
Teacher_MATH : so, okay, so I'll do the first eight, how's that?
Student_MATH : first eight. okay.
Teacher_MATH : all right. so I agree, that's plus twelve. wait a minute, which one are we doing?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : number six. that's plus eight, right?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : two, four, six, eight. good.
Teacher_MATH : now negative five thirds would mean you come down five and you go over three, right?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : so that one's perfect. number seven. you would have started at negative one and because of the negative four slope you would have gone down four and over one.
Student_MATH : number three.
Teacher_MATH : so that one is perfect.
Student_MATH : and number eight?
Teacher_MATH : okay. and number eight, I'm a little concerned. see how it's slanting up? see, eight's a negative one third.
Student_MATH : yeah, but that's a plus twelve.
Teacher_MATH : so are you ready? well what does plus twelve mean?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : up here. 
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : so erase number eight. try number eight again. okay?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : all right, wait a minute Jessica... all right, let me slow down, then. because trust me, I'm sick and I'm also tired but we can do this, all right. you ready?
Student_MATH : zero, three, and six is right, though, right?
Teacher_MATH : zero was twelve. so why did you plot down here, when zero positive twelve is up there.
Student_MATH : oh, I made a mistake.
Teacher_MATH : okay, let's look at the rest of your table.
Student_MATH : I put a negative.
Teacher_MATH : so three. all right, if I put a three here, DeCarlos, what's one third of three?
Student_MATH : um, one.
Teacher_MATH : one, right?
Teacher_MATH : so that negative makes it a negative one plus twelve, which was a positive... so you had these points exactly right.
Student_MATH : I check... I put them backwards.
Teacher_MATH : so you put them down... you plotted wrong, basically, right?
Student_MATH : yeah.
Teacher_MATH : all right.
Student_MATH : Mister Ormsby?
Teacher_MATH : okay, all right. yes? you're finally done, right?
Student_MATH : yes.
Teacher_MATH : okay.
Teacher_MATH : if you don't mind I'll just take a quick glance. spot check a few of them because I'd like you to move on to the questions.
Student_MATH : ok. alright.
Teacher_MATH : start answering the questions. okay?
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : and the ones I'm looking at right now, like for example, this one here this is number seven. that looks good. 
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : number six, five over three, that looks perfect. okay. 
Student_MATH : (silent)
Teacher_MATH : oh, let me see. you just finished ten, right?
Student_MATH : mm hm.
Teacher_MATH : and that one's also perfect. so I can safely say that you guys seem to know what you're doing.Teacher_SCIENCE : good morning! 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : fine, how are you?
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : sorry. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : go away, jeffrey. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes, I think that would be a wise idea. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : jason
Student_SCIENCE : I was absent tuesday, so I need to make what I need to make up. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : what I know about polymers. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, those are your notes, right
Student_SCIENCE : those are hers. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh, those are hers, that lesson? 
Student_SCIENCE : I was... no, I don't think so.
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's right, you were studying. Okay.
Teacher_SCIENCE : and who did you borrow those from, ginger? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : two things about polymers. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you remember
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay guys, about thirty seconds to finish your thoughts. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : something that you know about polymers, based on last class period. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : something that you know about polymers
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : jim
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, that uh manmade polymers are stronger than natural ones? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : could be. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so they come in two kinds, manmade and natural. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : somebody else
Teacher_SCIENCE : charlotte
Student_SCIENCE : doesn't poly mean many, many? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : poly means many. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that i'll let you do? 
Student_SCIENCE : cheat. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you can use this for a test
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, sam, uh, terrence
Student_SCIENCE : they're gigantic molecules? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're gigantic molecules. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : um, daphne
Student_SCIENCE : mono means one. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mono means one. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and what's so important about mono?
Student_SCIENCE : it takes three mono's to make a polymer. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : but give me kind of a definition of a monomer? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me? 
Student_SCIENCE : a chain? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : anybody? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what is a monomer
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh, aimee
Student_SCIENCE : are they simple molecules? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created? 
Student_SCIENCE : a polymer. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : bingo! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so mono means what
Student_SCIENCE : one. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : one. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, good
Teacher_SCIENCE : anybody else
Teacher_SCIENCE : crystal
Student_SCIENCE : polymers are molecules joined together. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mono ... okay, polymers are molecules joined together. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and they're joined together, how are they joined together
Teacher_SCIENCE : I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me? 
Student_SCIENCE : .., I don't know, like, they're just around each other. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're around one another and they're linked together. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what are they linked together in, samantha
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created? 
Student_SCIENCE : a chain? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : bingo! 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : thank you, a chain
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : anything else you want to add to this
Student_SCIENCE : “mer” means molecules? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, we can write this
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : I was trying to kinda remember, remember “molecule” okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : samantha
Student_SCIENCE : they can be all scrunched together? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : up and down and side to side. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and we're gonna take this one step further today in class. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains ... can kinda be arranged two different ways. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and then how's the other one
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you remember
Student_SCIENCE : scrunched together. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : scrunched together kinda like? 
Student_SCIENCE : crisscross? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : kinda like crisscrossed. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that? 
Student_SCIENCE : mm+hm. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you guys remember that? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper
Teacher_SCIENCE : how were the chains arranged
Teacher_SCIENCE : dave? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross? 
Student_SCIENCE : parallel. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper? 
Student_SCIENCE : rip it easy. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you could rip it very, very easily. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, what was the other thing that we used in class
Teacher_SCIENCE : does anybody remember
Teacher_SCIENCE : aimee? 
Student_SCIENCE : tyvek. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : tyvek. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and how were the molecules arranged in the tyvek
Student_SCIENCE : crisscross. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the tyvek? 
Student_SCIENCE : made it hard to tear. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : made it very, very hard to tear. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac ... actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, I'm going to go over here on the overhead, guys; I'm not gonna turn the lights off because I'm not gonna be up here for very long, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : kind of a r ... kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : this is “monomers”. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : this is actually polystyrene, which is up here; it's a plastic container. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the ... of the chemical names of the polymers? 
Student_SCIENCE : poly. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created? 
Student_SCIENCE : polymer. 
Student_SCIENCE : a polymer. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : a polymer. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, good
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : the arrangement of chains can influence the behavior of the polymers, whose properties are different from the original elements. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : here you have a whole bunch of elements, you put them together and you've created something brand new. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and how they were arranged in the tyvek. 
Student_SCIENCE : can we draw it? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you may draw it. absolutely.
Teacher_SCIENCE : what ... how did that newspaper behave? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : questions so far
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : questions
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : questions
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : excellent
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : all righty
Teacher_SCIENCE : This is investigating polymers activity part one. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. all righty. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : the first polymer ... jim, you want to share something
Student_SCIENCE : uh, no. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's this one right up in here. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's called plumber's tape
Teacher_SCIENCE : I don't know if you guys can see it from here
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : if you go into home depot and you say, “i need plumber's tape” they know exactly what you're talking about. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : but if you go into home depot and say, “i need poly tetra fluoro ethylene” they may not know what you're talking about. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : here you've got the “poly” which means the many. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : does anybody here know what tetra means
Student_SCIENCE : “tetra” means a number. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : it means, like ... hold on, no, I thought ..
Teacher_SCIENCE : anybody here know what “tetra” means? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, tetra is a number
Teacher_SCIENCE : usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : fluoro is probably fluorine off of the, uh, element table and then ethylene is also another couple of different elements off of the periodic table. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you guys know what I'm talking about
Student_SCIENCE : duct tape? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : this stuff. not duct tape, plumber's tape
Student_SCIENCE : oh.
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's plumber's tape in here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, its not sticky but it's like ... it's when you wrap it, it squeezes really tight around things, it's like teflon tape. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you can fix gas leaks with it. 
Student_SCIENCE : that's what I used it for
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too
Teacher_SCIENCE : as a matter of fact, yeah, also known as teflon, so you're correct in that assumption. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes, charlotte
Student_SCIENCE : I wrapped it around my finger and it turned my finger all purple. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : well, yeah I think so. if you wrap anything around your finger it's gonna turn your finger all purple
Teacher_SCIENCE : anybody else? does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and I kinda dispersed it around that way you ... people around you can take a look at it, too. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : nice and flat if you possibly can
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : let's see. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : jessica, i'll give you some
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, can everybody ... samantha, I'm going to give you some since you guys can take a look at that. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : what about over here on this side of the room? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, jason, I'm gonna get you a piece, too, I think I have another piece up here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, yeah
Student_SCIENCE : you can't touch it? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes, you can. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : you just leave it flat. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and actually they'll make another type, this is more for, pipes and there is another one that's a little bit more flimsier. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that. 
Student_SCIENCE : how does it stick under the pipe? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : actually, it just does it by, whe ... eh, you're gonna figure that out. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm not gonna tell you, you're gonna figure that one out
Student_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : see whether or not your ink pen or pencil, whatever that you're using on it right now, that you can write your initials on it. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : see if you can do that. with the plumber's tape
Teacher_SCIENCE : if you guys want to feel it, who doesn't have any, you guys can actually see what that feels like. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's kinda really smooth; it kinda feels good. 
Student_SCIENCE : mine won't work. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : huh? 
Student_SCIENCE : it ripped through. 
Student_SCIENCE : me too. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's okay, it ripped through? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay then maybe you don't want to go in too deep, then
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh good
Student_SCIENCE : miss? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : cool. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, good
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right, ladies and gents, we know this is a polymer because I told you that. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk ... everybody, jason, got it? 
Student_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : now, do you see the tape? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : you see the top part of the tape and you see the bottom part of the tape
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : top and the bottom part of the tape
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : I want you to ever so gently stretch it out. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : just ever so gently stretch it out
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : from top to bottom
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and, other people in the classroom, if you want to take a look at what they're doing, make sure they're doing it right
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon. okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : I didn't make a cute little ribbon. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you didn't make a cute little ribbon? okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : it looks like yellow bacon. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : looks like yellow bacon, okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : so, that's something that I could do with this
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, can you guys see that?
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right. now, I stretched it this way. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : did that tell me anything about how the chains were, in the middle of the tape?
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : no you didn't, okay.
Teacher_SCIENCE : now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and tell me what happens. 
Student_SCIENCE : the chains... go back to normal
Teacher_SCIENCE : it goes back to normal. okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and if you want to have your other partners or somebody who didn't have a chance to do this, do this again
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : my name would be real distorted. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : but if I were to pull like this I would have my name nice nice and original again; normal again. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : what does this tell you? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : based on what this can do
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you think they're parallel to one another or do you think that they're crisscrossed? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : depending on what I can do with this
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : I see some hands going up. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : some hands going up
Teacher_SCIENCE : jessica. 
Student_SCIENCE : parallel. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're parallel. And why do you think they're parallel?
Student_SCIENCE : because you can stretch it from side to side and it's kind of easy to do, and if it was crisscrossed it would be harder. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. I agree with that
Teacher_SCIENCE : just by pulling it this way, its giving you an indication that the chains are parallel. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : if the chains were crisscrossed do you think we'd be able to get it back to its original way real quick? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, we don't
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : how were the chains arranged? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : that the chains were arranged in that certain way? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : then tell me what evidence did you see that gives you an indication that the chains were arranged parallel. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : .., well you really got yours stretched out, huh? 
Student_SCIENCE : .. I had ... I got carried away with it. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you got carried away with it, so what do you think happened to your poor chains? 
Student_SCIENCE : I ripped it. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : you ripped it, too. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and I ripped it too. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : this brings up a point. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : jason's poor plumber's tape, he really got it really stretched out
Student_SCIENCE : but I supported my scientific thing. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you ... okay. you took it one step further
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : what do you think happened to these poor polymer chains, from what jason did to them
Student_SCIENCE : they got broken.
Teacher_SCIENCE : what do you think happened? 
Student_SCIENCE : they got stretched too far so they ripped. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. stretched too far so they ripped, very good
Student_SCIENCE : or do they actually get more like ... do they all get thinner? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they will actually stretch out and get thinner. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : well, I shouldn't ... and sometimes that all depends, too
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right
Teacher_SCIENCE : and I hope I'm going to be successful with it today. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : I was semi+successful with it yesterday
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : jim? 
Student_SCIENCE : but still, if you got, like, your arm cut off or something, then all your polymer chains will be cut and everything? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh, absolutely. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : absolutely. 
Student_SCIENCE : then how do you have polymer chains in your blood, dna, and everything? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : well that's because you got to consider all polymers as a gigantic molecule. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's smaller molecules put together
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and all they are just smaller molecules that are hooked up together. 
Student_SCIENCE : so whenever, like, you find a piece of dna that's not like your entire dna string, it's just a little piece. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no it's not. it's a little piece
Student_SCIENCE : so is your entire dna string, like, going up and down through your body all the way? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no. that big old gigantic molecule is really, really, coiled inside the nucleus. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you guys, do you remember that
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : and, yeah, and you can actually stretch that molecule out its very, very long. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : but it's not all up and down your arm. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's compacted inside of every single cell inside of your body, that has a nucleus
Student_SCIENCE : how are polymers arranged inside the body? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it all depends. all depends.
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : um, some could be arranged parallel, some could be arranged crisscross, some could be cross+linked together
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : all depends on what they're what they're needed for, what they're used for. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, any questions
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : any other questions
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : this will be the last demo that I do and them I'm gonna break you up into your lab groups for you to investigate your own polymer. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : did somebody in here know how to blow up a balloon really, really well and tie it off? 
Student_SCIENCE : I do! 
Student_SCIENCE : I do. 
Student_SCIENCE : jason pulled ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do me a favor, when you blow the balloons up, don't blow them up all the way. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, ta, that's ... that's cool, right there. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's good. thank you. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : and jason is dying over there, huh
Student_SCIENCE : I like balloons. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : thank you. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. all right, we've got another problem
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : we have found another polymer and we want to investigate again how the polymer ... the chains in this polymer are arranged, okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : so we're gonna do a couple of things to the balloon to figure it out. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh, what I'm going to do I'm gonna take a skewer
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : i'll dip it in some oil just to be on the safe side to make it go in a little bit, how should I say, a little smoother. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : easy? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : where should I put the skewer? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : somebody in here tell me
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : like we did with the plumber's tape we stretched it different ways to see whether or not we could figure out how the chains are going. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh, same thing with the balloon. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : jim, what do you think
Student_SCIENCE : poke it right on top. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : poke it on the top? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, right there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : anybody want to go in the side
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : ah, stuart wants to go on the side. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, stuart doesn't want to go on the side, all right
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : stuart, we're gonna go on the side, for you, okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : we're gonna go on the side. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : what do you think's gonna happen
Student_SCIENCE : pop! 
Student_SCIENCE : pop. 
Student_SCIENCE : it's gonna pop. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : why? 
Student_SCIENCE : I think it'll go through. 
Student_SCIENCE : I think
Teacher_SCIENCE : you think it'll go through? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, let's see what happens. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, ready
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh golly, that popped. 
Student_SCIENCE : that popped; that was a big one. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : now do it right in the bottom; right where all the thick stuff is. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : right where all the thick stuff is, huh? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, might not pop there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you think the, the, the thick stuff is not on the side? 
Student_SCIENCE : no. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no? 
Student_SCIENCE : cause it's stretched out inside there on the top, but down where the bottom is it's not blown up all the way, so it's thicker on the bottom. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : let's find out
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : (silent)
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. popped. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : just to be on the safe side. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, it still popped! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's because I haven't been successful with this all day long. 
Student_SCIENCE : try the bottom, the bottom. 
Student_SCIENCE : where the little tie thing is
Student_SCIENCE : at the bottom. 
Student_SCIENCE : where it's tied. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : tie thing? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I don't like that one. 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, get a new one. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : I wanna see that one ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you're sure, huh? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh! 
Student_SCIENCE : there we go! 
Student_SCIENCE : now the other side. 
Student_SCIENCE : ah! 
Student_SCIENCE : .. too long. 
Student_SCIENCE : here i'll blow one up again. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : well whatev ... give me two more, cause I told yo
Teacher_SCIENCE : but so far we got one part of it working, right? 
SS_SCIENCE : .. yes, sure. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and don't blow them up really too ... don't stretch them out too much. 
Student_SCIENCE : I want the long one. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : here, try that one. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, yes. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, good. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : thank you. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : perfect
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm gonna be successful with this. 
Student_SCIENCE : yes. 
Student_SCIENCE : use the force. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : use the force. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : all righty. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : here I go
Teacher_SCIENCE : should I try a different skewer
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, they're bad luck. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : here we go
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm gonna go from this end first
Student_SCIENCE : it's gonna pop. 
Student_SCIENCE : it's gonna pop. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : don't say that! 
Student_SCIENCE : oh well. 
Student_SCIENCE : pop. 
Student_SCIENCE : there we go! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : ah! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : success
Student_SCIENCE : this is my balloon! 
Student_SCIENCE : it's my ..
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : all righty
Teacher_SCIENCE : but when I put the skewer I this way, it didn't pop. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what's the difference between the chains here and the chains here? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what's the difference? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what's the difference
Teacher_SCIENCE : crystal
Student_SCIENCE : it's parallel. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : well, don't know if it's parallel. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what's the difference between the way the chains are arranged here
Teacher_SCIENCE : not so much whether their parallel or crisscross right now, but jim had said this before. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : jason
Student_SCIENCE : it just, like, makes it pop cause it won't stretch into where you .. to go inside. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, and then what about the top? 
Student_SCIENCE : they're so loose so you can just stick something in it and it will pop right away. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, excellent. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so how do you think the polymer chains are arranged
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you think they're parallel or you think they're crisscrossed
Student_SCIENCE : ones on the top are parallel and the ones on the side are crisscrossed? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : anybody else has anything different, jim
Student_SCIENCE : so when you stick something in they just like ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : question. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I like that explanation
Teacher_SCIENCE : and what jim said was, he felt that the polymer chains are crisscrossed
Teacher_SCIENCE : the ones at the top are crisscrossed, they're not stretched out, so when you poke something through it, the chains just kind of ... what was the word that you used? 
Student_SCIENCE : squeezed around it. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and so when you try to put a skewer through it, are you really getting ... you don't ... they can't squeeze together. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I think that's the word that he used. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : the polymer chains can't squeeze together
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : so, we learned that the balloon is what type of polymer? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : parallel or crisscrossed
SS_SCIENCE : crisscrossed. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : crisscrossed. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and this is a little bit more compacted than this over here
Teacher_SCIENCE : so what ... what can you tell me about polymers
Teacher_SCIENCE : think about this. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : according to the balloon, what can polymers do
Teacher_SCIENCE : what could we do to them
Teacher_SCIENCE : somebody's saying it, I can hear it. 
Student_SCIENCE : they can stretch out. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, they can stretch out, so polymers can stretch out. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what I want you to do here no
Teacher_SCIENCE : and what evidence do you have if the chains are arranged that way? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and if you guys want to draw a picture, you can go for it and draw a picture, it's not a problem. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : chains compacted together at the to
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, so the way the chains are arranged, tells me something about the behavior of the material. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. is not here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : are you understanding this all okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : he haS't been here for a while. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : was he on vacation
Teacher_SCIENCE : he is
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, it looks like pencils are down. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right, somebody no
Teacher_SCIENCE : what did you learn about polymers today? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what could you write down on there
Teacher_SCIENCE : cedrick? 
Student_SCIENCE : polymers can expand. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh yes, polymers can expand. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : or you can use the word we can stretch the polymers out. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : anything else? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : how's bingo
Teacher_SCIENCE : bingo, bingo
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, nothing else
Teacher_SCIENCE : nothing else
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, please go ahead and take this paper, now flip it over to the back, because now I'm going to let you investigate one on your own. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : all righty
Teacher_SCIENCE : and the one I'm going to have you investigate on your own, is this one here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so that there's not going to be any questions ... you won't have any questions when you go into a lab, hopefully. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, investigating polymers. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : we investigated the balloon and we investigated the plumber's tape
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm gonna have you go out and investigate the ... a plastic container, or the polystyrene. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and that's what you're going to investigate right there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : again, we have this question in our head, we have to figure out how these chains are arranged. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you're gonna do a couple of things to this plastic container to see whether or not you can figure out how the chains are arranged. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and, as you're writing this I'm gonna go ahead and share with you, you guys can go into your lab group, three to a lab group. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : “okay guys, you have a minute to fi ... or actually thirty seconds to find the partners and a lab station” okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, so I know you're all looking around at one another going “yeah, yeah, yeah” okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : but let me have your eyeballs back up here because we gotta go through this. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and I'm gonna show you what the plastic containers look like. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : plastic containers look like this
Teacher_SCIENCE : you guys all recognize these plastic containers. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : where do you see these
Teacher_SCIENCE : look! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, the cheesy hamburgers are in there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : in the cafeteria
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right, what you're gonna do is that you're going to take this plastic container and you're going to cut into a shape. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and you guys can choose whether you want to cut it into a square, rectangle, or triangle. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : the only reason why I'm asking you for those three particular shapes is because they're kinda easier to measure. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I don't care how big you cut this out; I don't care how small you cut this out, that's your choice. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : there's a very, very flat part to the container. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you guys see the flat part
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, so when you get into your lab groups, you just need to make sure that you're cutting off those ripply edge stuff. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and I'm not doing a very good job. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I cut the flat part out. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : from the flat part then you can cut your triangle, you can cut your square, you can cut your rectangle and you guys can cut it any size. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : just remember you have two flat sections here for three people. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so you're gonna have to figure out how you're going to divvy up two sections for three people, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right, so that's the first thing you're gonna do. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you're going to trace the figure. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so once you cut the figure out, I want you to trace it, and then I want you to take measurements. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and I'm gonna tell you how I want you to take these measurements. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you have rulers, in your containers back there at your lab station. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what you need to do, is that you need to measure the sides
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : or if you have a triangle then you have three sides, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you're gonna take these measurements in
Student_SCIENCE : centimeters. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : centimeters. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : then, you are going to go and you're going to give me a measurement of mass
Teacher_SCIENCE : now, what is in the classroom that's going to help you figure out how the mass of the little piece of plastic? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what's hanging around here? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : daphne
Student_SCIENCE : the triple beam balance. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : the triple beam balance. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so you're gonna use the triple beam balance to help you figure out the mass
Teacher_SCIENCE : and how do you measure mass
Teacher_SCIENCE : in
Student_SCIENCE : grams. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : grams, okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and then, give me some characteristics of the plastic. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : in other words, after you've cut your little shape out, tell me, what does it look like
Teacher_SCIENCE : tell me something about the physical characteristics of that piece of plastic. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what does it feel like? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what does it smell like
Teacher_SCIENCE : don't taste it
Teacher_SCIENCE : and you're going to do all of this two times. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you're going to do this ... yeah, watch, before you heat it and then after you heat it
Teacher_SCIENCE : with this piece of plastic we're gonna put it in the toaster oven and we're gonna see what happens. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so I've got the toaster oven up here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm gonna man the toaster oven
Teacher_SCIENCE : so, once it's been heated you're gonna take it back to your lab station and you're gonna do all this all over again. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : question
Student_SCIENCE : what if ... what if whenever we heat it, it like melts and we can't touch it? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh, I don't know we'll have to see. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : we'll have to see
Teacher_SCIENCE : you have to put all this information, the before and the after heating into a data table. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you guys remember what your data tables looked like from before in the past, right? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I want you and your partners to figure out what your data table is going to look like. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and you have to have all of this for all three of you lab partners on one data table. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : we'd all cut out ... figure out our own different measurements, but we would share them with one another. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so by the time I'm done, I have samantha's, terrence's, and my own all on the data table. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : before and after
Teacher_SCIENCE : is that clear
Student_SCIENCE : yes. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : is that clear? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : because there was some confusion about that this morning in class
Teacher_SCIENCE : so you're gonna put everybody's data on here
Teacher_SCIENCE : you are going to trace everybody's figure on your paper. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so when you create your data table you need to keep that in mind, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : cedrick
Teacher_SCIENCE : question
Student_SCIENCE : no, I just ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : all righty
Teacher_SCIENCE : no questions? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I think I've covered everything
Teacher_SCIENCE : tuh+duh, tuh+duh
Teacher_SCIENCE : yep, I have
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : and then I will call you, group by group, to the toaster oven. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm gonna man it and then you can take your plastic back to the lab, okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : so when you're ready just raise your hand and i'll let you come up here and we'll put it in the toaster oven. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : there are some conclusion questions that are on the board behind this board over here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and somewhere in the middle of the lab, i'll push that board over so that you actually can see those conclusion questions, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : ladies and gents, this is a lab today that you need to make sure that you are taking very careful measurements. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what did I just say
SS_SCIENCE : very careful measurements. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, very careful measurements, because ... I'm not gonna tell you, but yeah, just go ahead and take very careful measurements, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, thirty seconds, find your partner and lab station. 
Student_SCIENCE : do you type those? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : um, eyeballs? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : let me double+check and see who you're working with real quick. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : three, three, three, three
Teacher_SCIENCE : you three ladies are together
Teacher_SCIENCE : julia, who are you with? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you two
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : three, it's you three
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, you three, and you three. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : do me a favor, monica, would you guys scoot down a little bit
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, thank you
Teacher_SCIENCE : keep scooting. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : that way we can get that group in totally over there
Teacher_SCIENCE : scoot all ... yeah, yeah, yeah, good. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : arthur scoot down some more
Teacher_SCIENCE : take your stool, yeah, take this stool and go right in the middle over there
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : once I hand out your plastic containers, you guys can go ahead and start
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay gentlemen, here you go. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh yes, yes, hurry up. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : give me your .. i'll give you a pass
Teacher_SCIENCE : you three ladies are together
SS_SCIENCE : mm+hm. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : is it just you and charlotte? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, just go. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : there you go
Teacher_SCIENCE : just you three gents? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you got some extras here, so use this and that
Student_SCIENCE : ..? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, good question guy
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. background music, it has to be Star_Wars. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you know what, there is another pair of scissors on the lab table over there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : let me get you some .. containers
Student_SCIENCE : and then we cut into this, right? 
Student_SCIENCE : I don't know, .. whatever you want. 
Student_SCIENCE : i'll get this ... 
Student_SCIENCE : it says, +"/
Student_SCIENCE : that's why I'm counting right here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. how are you gonna organize this data table? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mm. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes, what do you need? 
Student_SCIENCE : do we need to trim it in three ways? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes, you do. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : so if I were you, I would cut out whatever you have left over you can give to leon. 
Student_SCIENCE : math. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, that's a good idea, too. 
Student_SCIENCE : and that will be a rectangle. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. made a whole square. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : did you guys just get one container? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, here, two. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : rectangle, we got it. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : jason, question? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what do you need? 
Student_SCIENCE : rulers. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they should be up there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : where are they
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh, here they are
Student_SCIENCE : I make a square. 
Student_SCIENCE : what are you making? 
Student_SCIENCE : what are you making? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I must have put them away yesterday, by accident. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : there you go
Student_SCIENCE : are you gonna make .. this? 
Student_SCIENCE : a rectangle? 
Student_SCIENCE : a rectangle? 
Student_SCIENCE : .. kind of make a small one. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, I've got one over here. 
Student_SCIENCE : how are we supposed to measure it, like. 
Student_SCIENCE : are we supposed to just put all the measurements in order
Student_SCIENCE : you should have paid attention
Teacher_SCIENCE : actually, it's pretty much clean; I cleaned them all yesterday so you should be okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : it's at seven and a half
Teacher_SCIENCE : you want to double check and make sure it's aligned correctly. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : we have to check. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and where is your shape? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : now if you guys need more rulers, you go over to my table and get some. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes, lance. 
Student_SCIENCE : ..? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : absolutely. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : hey gentlemen, before you start, .. think about ... let me you look at your data table. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : how did you pull that, how did you arrange that data table? 
Student_SCIENCE : what data table? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. you have to have a data table ... 
Student_SCIENCE : or not
Teacher_SCIENCE : all of you have to make a data table. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : remember
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, but .. paper. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and you were correct, okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : but, you guys need to talk about how you're gonna put that data table together before you do anything. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : you just make a square, and then .. before and after. 
Student_SCIENCE : why not do a triangle? 
Student_SCIENCE : triangles are cooler
Teacher_SCIENCE : ladies. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh yes, you do have a data table
Teacher_SCIENCE : let me take a look at that
Teacher_SCIENCE : is this yours? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. table
Student_SCIENCE : oh, we have to trim. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so how is that gonna fit in there
Student_SCIENCE : um, mine could fit. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so maybe you need to expand them. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : but they're good, just make them a little bit bigger
Student_SCIENCE : I need like another piece of paper or something. 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : um, woo. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do I like fractions
SS_SCIENCE : no. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, I don't. 
Student_SCIENCE : anyone got paper? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and, have you guys figured out how you're gonna put your data table? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : fourteen sixteenths
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you know what, if I were you I'd re+measure that, and it will give you a decimal
Student_SCIENCE : how do you do it with a decimal? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : watch. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, you get a decimal? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : point two. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, so you have to do it in centimeters
Student_SCIENCE : okay, I try. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so I'm concerned ... you got a before and you got an after, but where is the room on the data table for his info and his info? 
Student_SCIENCE : uh, I'm gonna do that later. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : ah, we wanna try, like, now. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : go get a ... go get another piece of paper if you need it. 
Student_SCIENCE : I don't have enough paper. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and how is your data table coming along, ladies? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : gentlemen, let me see your data table. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : let's re+group here, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you have to get ... is this your figure
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, it's my figure. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you have to get all the .. let me see your piece of plastic
Teacher_SCIENCE : your piece of plastic
Teacher_SCIENCE : where is the other
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, you gotta get all three of these somehow traced on your paper because that needs to be included in your data table, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : this one looks like its chipped and you're going to just give me a measurement here, this looks to be about four point nine? 
Student_SCIENCE : mm+hm. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so when you trace it, you can put down on this side “four point nine centimeters” okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : ..
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, yeah and you know what? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : sometimes an easier way is just to put all your data inside of it
Teacher_SCIENCE : does that make sense
Student_SCIENCE : oh, ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and how are you guys coming along here
Student_SCIENCE : good, we got our data table. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you got your data table? 
Student_SCIENCE : yep. 
Student_SCIENCE : almost. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : almost? 
Student_SCIENCE : he stole my ruler. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, so you got before and after. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so share with me what's gonna go in here
Teacher_SCIENCE : the characteristics? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : before and then after you heat it up
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, now do you have enough time to trace it? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : let me give you a hint here. 
Student_SCIENCE : information inside of it! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : bingo! 
Student_SCIENCE : yes! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes. 
Student_SCIENCE : why didn't you tell me before? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : well, that's an easy way. 
Student_SCIENCE : I could poke an eye on it. 
Student_SCIENCE : so now I have to make my data table out of my whole piece of paper. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah you can, be careful. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, not necessarily. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : just erase these little lines and just kinda extend the data table down longer
Student_SCIENCE : oh. 
Student_SCIENCE : right. 
Student_SCIENCE : what was I gonna ask? 
Student_SCIENCE : what are you doing? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : good, I like it! 
Student_SCIENCE : thank you. 
Student_SCIENCE : .., what was your side one? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes? 
Student_SCIENCE : I think we forgot ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : well, let's double+check. 
Student_SCIENCE : I need to copy ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so, you have to tell me is this before heating or after heating. 
Student_SCIENCE : before. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, somehow you need to let me know that. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : all right. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and you ladies, how are you coming along? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : let's see it. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, that's smart. 
Student_SCIENCE : and then you can put all your measurements on the inside, okay
Student_SCIENCE : that's good
Student_SCIENCE : of each one? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : gentlemen, .. done? 
Student_SCIENCE : are you done
Student_SCIENCE : are you massing
Student_SCIENCE : finding the mass
Student_SCIENCE : what are you doing
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm measuring. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, your measuring. 
Student_SCIENCE : stuart, what are you doing
Teacher_SCIENCE : waiting for the ruler. 
Student_SCIENCE : you can always get another one off of my desk. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's crazy! 
SS_SCIENCE : jason, are we having a conversation about polymers? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : all right. 
Student_SCIENCE : so, I don't have to make a .. table, right
Teacher_SCIENCE : you got to get carpet in here because carpet cleans your erasers. 
Student_SCIENCE : no, no carpet in a science room. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. erase the ground. 
Student_SCIENCE : now how do I make the graph? 
Student_SCIENCE : you don't have to make a graph, dude. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you want me to .. all the sides of the others? 
Student_SCIENCE : no, you're not going to give me .., you're not going to give me a parameter or an area; all you've got to do is give me the measurements. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : your not going to do any type of math calculation today
Teacher_SCIENCE : awesome. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : awesome, huh? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes. 
Student_SCIENCE : are you guys ready to heat? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : if I were you, I would somehow put this ... block this off and put a title up here before heating. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, that way you can tell the difference. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : so, daphne, you're almost done
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : now, what are we tracing? 
Student_SCIENCE : you're tracing, like, on your thing, on your data table. 
Student_SCIENCE : I'm writing the atom? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : no, look, theo, look at your writer. 
Student_SCIENCE : the very first ... the ... yeah
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, but ... 
Student_SCIENCE : do we have to put all in there? 
Student_SCIENCE : you can make it even. 
Student_SCIENCE : i'll do mine, you do yours. 
Student_SCIENCE : just like we don't know it
Teacher_SCIENCE : do we have to graph it? 
Student_SCIENCE : did I say anything about graphing? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes, the data table, and this looks to me like you've got one coming here, okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : so you're all right. 
Student_SCIENCE : so do you have everybody's data
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, do you have all the masses? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, let me double+check your masses here. 
Student_SCIENCE : where am I gonna find that on your data table
Teacher_SCIENCE : right here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : inside the little .. shape
Student_SCIENCE : well then you're going to need to identify how it's being massed. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : shall I put “mass” above it? 
Student_SCIENCE : okay that's fine, as long as I know what the mass is. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, it did it perfect. 
Student_SCIENCE : I know, I changed it. 
Student_SCIENCE : no, I changed it. 
Student_SCIENCE : I changed this little knot. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, I changed it. 
Student_SCIENCE : are you guys ready to heat? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : mm. 
Student_SCIENCE : but see? 
Student_SCIENCE : now what do you do
Student_SCIENCE : so, my suggestion to you is ... am I looking at data here for before heating or after heating? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : before. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, so make sure I know that. 
Student_SCIENCE : you gotta ... how do ... how do I know that
Teacher_SCIENCE : you make another thing; you .. down here? 
Student_SCIENCE : you can't do that, so if I were you I'd scratch that out so that I know that you're doing ... yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. do that. 
Student_SCIENCE : that's fine. 
Student_SCIENCE : maybe you wan ... want to block the whole thing off so I know that's all before heating
Teacher_SCIENCE : here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : right here
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, good. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, I think you guys are ready
Student_SCIENCE : are you guys ready too? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, bring your plastic on up. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, ladies and gents. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : shh, eyeballs
Teacher_SCIENCE : eyeballs. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and then I will call you up here, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : once you're done, go back and do the after heating measurements
Student_SCIENCE : once you're done with all the after heating stuff then you are to? 
Student_SCIENCE : record? 
Student_SCIENCE : to record it? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : record it? 
Student_SCIENCE : absolutely record it, but say for instance everything's done with your lab, what are you gonna do next? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : go to your seat and read something? 
Student_SCIENCE : sit in your seat and do the? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : finish your questions. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : bingo! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, here we go, ready
Student_SCIENCE : all right, so you guys need to cuddle around, place your, ouch! 
Student_SCIENCE : it's hot
Student_SCIENCE : that's why I have the mitt
Teacher_SCIENCE : you can move it up front. 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, put it up front so you guys can remember it. 
Student_SCIENCE : daphne
Teacher_SCIENCE : let's put them all ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, put it all on the pan. 
Student_SCIENCE : you've got it on the pan? 
Student_SCIENCE : all right, now you've got to look through the window and see what's happening
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. shrink it in? 
Student_SCIENCE : I don't know, we'll find ... oh! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, hold on. 
Student_SCIENCE : trala, trala, da, da. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mine's ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so there should be five. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, here we go
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right, now crowd around and watch what happens
Student_SCIENCE : jason. 
Student_SCIENCE : what's happening? 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, a whole lot of that. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, they were mine
Student_SCIENCE : oh wow, look at that! 
Student_SCIENCE : ew, they're like folding. 
Student_SCIENCE : they're like. 
Student_SCIENCE : and they're shrinking. 
Student_SCIENCE : they're shrinkadee. 
Student_SCIENCE : and they're hardening as well, look. 
Student_SCIENCE : that one's going into kind of like a cup form. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : ew! 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : what's so “ew” about it? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you gotta wait. 
Student_SCIENCE : let's see. 
Student_SCIENCE : does it look like ... does it look like they're done
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, they're still moving. 
Student_SCIENCE : they're still moving? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, and they ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, yours have flattened out now, okay, that's why I've got the oven mitt on, so I don't burn myself
Student_SCIENCE : these are hot, so you want to be very careful when you pick them up. 
Student_SCIENCE : that's mine. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, it's mine. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, very careful when you pick them up. 
Student_SCIENCE : there you go
Student_SCIENCE : it's not that hot. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's hot? 
Student_SCIENCE : ah! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : that one's mine. 
Student_SCIENCE : there you go. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're steaming. 
SS_SCIENCE : they're hot? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I didn't think they were that hot. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, team ten, team nine, if you guys are ready. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, place it on the pan. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : pan's hot. 
Student_SCIENCE : anywhere on the pan ... yes, the pan's hot, so be careful. 
Student_SCIENCE : ooh. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : now, can we taste this stuff? 
Student_SCIENCE : no, you cannot taste it. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it smells like gingerbread. 
Student_SCIENCE : I know, it's because it's close to lunch, too. 
Student_SCIENCE : gimme your plastics and put them on a pan
Student_SCIENCE : he'll get it, ... 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah
Teacher_SCIENCE : what were you baking in here earlier? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, I make my little cinnamon rolls on here. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, here we go
Teacher_SCIENCE : we should make some ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : now, you ladies need to come around here so you can see what's going on in the window. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : make some observations about what's going on with the plastic through the window
Student_SCIENCE : okay, scoot in closer. 
Student_SCIENCE : it shouldn't explode
SS_SCIENCE : oh, look at that ... 
Student_SCIENCE : oh! 
Student_SCIENCE : it's really. 
Student_SCIENCE : look
Student_SCIENCE : it's, like, turning into pieces of cheese. 
Student_SCIENCE : cool. 
Student_SCIENCE : and then you can, like, .. them to your .. and everything. 
Student_SCIENCE : how are we supposed to make it, ..? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's like ... it's like, ... 
Student_SCIENCE : are you ready? 
Student_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : it looks like, .. in seven years. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh my god! 
Student_SCIENCE : so you think they're done, now? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no. 
Student_SCIENCE : no? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : until they get brown, then they're done. 
Student_SCIENCE : so what do think's happened to those polymer chains? 
Student_SCIENCE : they squish up to ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : shrinking. 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah
Student_SCIENCE : you think they're done? 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, aimee, let me change places with you
Student_SCIENCE : where's yours? 
Student_SCIENCE : is it still there
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, mine is, like, .. tiny. 
Student_SCIENCE : whoa, gosh that smells. 
Student_SCIENCE : it's not on fire, is it? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : not on fire? 
Student_SCIENCE : no, not like the other fire we had here the other day. 
Student_SCIENCE : not my room. 
Student_SCIENCE : still hot? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's just cool
Student_SCIENCE : careful. 
Student_SCIENCE : that one's good. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's like glass. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's like ... cause it feels different, huh? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah it's hard. 
Student_SCIENCE : mine's. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, I see mine
Student_SCIENCE : it's so beautiful. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh it's hot. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's like glass. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : um, is there anybody else that's ready to put it in the oven
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, team five and team seven
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, put them down on the pan. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : careful, pan's hot
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm gonna scoot yours over just a tad so you guys want to remember where they're at. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : gentlemen, over here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : the pan is hot, so place them on there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, now I want you to look through the window and I want you to observe what's happening. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so gents, you guys need to come over here. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : come on dennis. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : over here, dennis the menace
Teacher_SCIENCE : come on, stuart. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : right here, right here, look
Student_SCIENCE : jeff? 
Student_SCIENCE : oh. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh my gosh, that's mine. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, it's like a star. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh my gosh, they're shrinking. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh my gosh, mine's like a polymer. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : look at mine, mine's dying. 
Student_SCIENCE : so what do think are happening to the chains? 
Student_SCIENCE : they're shrinking. 
Student_SCIENCE : they're shrinking. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, they're kinda, maybe, kinda pulling back together, huh? 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, you think they're done? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're not moving anymore. 
Student_SCIENCE : not moving anymore? 
Student_SCIENCE : what do you think would happen if I left them in here for a long, long time? 
Student_SCIENCE : they're barely ... 
Student_SCIENCE : they'd probably disappear
Teacher_SCIENCE : or they melt? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they might melt. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : because you need to notice that they definitely were curled up the pad. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're so small. 
Student_SCIENCE : oopsy. 
Student_SCIENCE : come on over here, this one's real small
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : all righty, they're you go gents, find ... and ladies find yours
SS_SCIENCE : are you guys ready? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's hot. 
Student_SCIENCE : are you ready? 
Student_SCIENCE : okay team three, in the window
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh, oh, me! 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, place them on the pan. 
Student_SCIENCE : the pan's hot, so be careful
Student_SCIENCE : one, twenty five, two. 
Student_SCIENCE : jim? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : are you guys ready, too? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what was your side two? 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, hold on one sec. 
Student_SCIENCE : everybody's plastic is on there
Teacher_SCIENCE : mm+hm. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, watch what's happening through the window. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. reference, that it's smooth. 
Student_SCIENCE : I mean, its still, like, see+through
Student_SCIENCE : and it got denser. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so it's, like, harder to trace and everything
Teacher_SCIENCE : do you guys need to go? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you guys need to go, right
Teacher_SCIENCE : team two and. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : team eight
Student_SCIENCE : what's happening to the polymer chains? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're shrinking. 
Student_SCIENCE : they're shrinking? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mm+hm. 
Student_SCIENCE : mm. 
Student_SCIENCE : is this one? 
Student_SCIENCE : what's yours? 
Student_SCIENCE : I don't know yet. 
Student_SCIENCE : what are you doing? 
Student_SCIENCE : that was fine
Student_SCIENCE : no it waS't. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it was, it was right on the ... 
Student_SCIENCE : let me get in here again. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're tiny. 
Student_SCIENCE : ah, they're tiny. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they're tiny. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : let me grab it. 
Student_SCIENCE : i'll just ... no, no, don't grab. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's all hard. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, you can take it, they're a little hot, so you want to be careful. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, arthur, they're not that hot. 
Student_SCIENCE : it burns. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : is there a smell? 
Student_SCIENCE : all right, team two and team eight? 
Student_SCIENCE : yes! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what about team six? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, put this on the ... oh, gosh you guys have big ones. 
Student_SCIENCE : ladies? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : miss ..? 
Student_SCIENCE : yes? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : ..? 
Student_SCIENCE : no, hold on to them. 
Student_SCIENCE : mine is cooler than yours. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mine is cooler than yours. 
Student_SCIENCE : all right, are you ready? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I wonder what would happen if I'd put my hand in there. 
Student_SCIENCE : what do you think, cedrick? 
Student_SCIENCE : shrink. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : this is yours, the little seven. 
Student_SCIENCE : all righty. 
Student_SCIENCE : there you go, look
Student_SCIENCE : is this the shrinkadee? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I thought you got cancer from working with ... 
Student_SCIENCE : that's a toaster oven. 
Student_SCIENCE : may I see your pen? 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, it won't work. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : nothing works on there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : um, ladies and gents. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : shh
Teacher_SCIENCE : ladies and gents, eyeballs for one quick second please, I forgot to mention something to you. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : please do not throw your little piece of plastic in the trash can. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : when you're done, bring it back to your table and i'll give you some tape
Teacher_SCIENCE : you're going to tape it on your paper. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : okay, how are you guys coming along? 
Student_SCIENCE : we're .. small, and smaller ... 
Student_SCIENCE : mine's the small one. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mine's the biggest. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mine's the biggest in there
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, so what do you think happened? 
Student_SCIENCE : hey, mine went back up. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : hey, mine spins. 
Student_SCIENCE : there you go. 
Student_SCIENCE : there you go
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh my god, it's so hot. 
Student_SCIENCE : be careful, they're all hot. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I don't even remember what mine looks like. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, go sit down gents. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right, is there anybody here that needs ... left to uh, put them in the oven? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's just one more group
Student_SCIENCE : okay, number six, come on up, and the other part of number six, last four ladies. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, put it in
Student_SCIENCE : oh, nice big ones
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : ginger, do you have yours? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you need to come up here
Teacher_SCIENCE : cause you need to ... to see what's going on
Teacher_SCIENCE : ready? 
Student_SCIENCE : and there we go. 
Student_SCIENCE : I've got ... 
Student_SCIENCE : no, but the little curvy parts run .. a little bumpy. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, my god it will leak! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : hey, calm down. 
Student_SCIENCE : jim, question? 
Student_SCIENCE : no, no staples, just have a seat. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. hotdog. 
Student_SCIENCE : they look like bugs. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. sick. 
Student_SCIENCE : it's like .., man, mine is gonna die. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they can ... ew. 
SS_SCIENCE : oh, okay. 
SS_SCIENCE : do you think they're done
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : mm+hm, yes. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : some are shrinking. 
Student_SCIENCE : you think so? 
Student_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : this looks like a bow. 
Student_SCIENCE : I keep forgetting, I have the mitt on the right hand. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : my gosh! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : where did it go
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh it went in the water. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : hold on, not a problem
Teacher_SCIENCE : it just got a cold, that's all
Student_SCIENCE : okay, there you go. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : can we take it away? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : take them away, they're yours
Student_SCIENCE : how are what are you gents doing? 
Student_SCIENCE : he's trying to touch my ... 
Student_SCIENCE : I need to trace it, okay? 
Student_SCIENCE : I need to trace it
Teacher_SCIENCE : look, it's not even level at ... as it is. 
Student_SCIENCE : what are you supposed to be doing? 
Student_SCIENCE : questions. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : um, we're being ... ah, we're answering the questions. 
Student_SCIENCE : uh+huh, correct. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do we answer it right here on the back? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : questions. 
Student_SCIENCE : yes? 
Student_SCIENCE : will we have, like, some rock band or some background music? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. number two ..? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : daphne, if you hold on, i'll explain that when I get more of the class sitting down together. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : is that what you have the question about, number two? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : most of you do, and I will tell you what I want you to do with that, let me wait for the ... just go on to number three if you can
Teacher_SCIENCE : ladies and gents, and you have about ten minutes left in the lab situation, making calculations+uh, making measurements. 
Student_SCIENCE : about ten minutes. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : can we have this piece of plastic? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, hold on. 
Student_SCIENCE : are you gents done? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and my suggestion is to have a seat and work on your questions. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : ladies, put the hat away. 
Student_SCIENCE : let me check your masses here. 
Student_SCIENCE : have you done masses yet
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : before and after mass? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : grams? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes, in the grams. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah, mine are done. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, oh yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : so we're at seventy point two
Teacher_SCIENCE : give me your rectangle. 
Student_SCIENCE : shh. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, here's a square. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yours is not giving any information about your stuff. 
Student_SCIENCE : well, are you done with your stuff? 
Student_SCIENCE : did you take a mass of this yet? 
Student_SCIENCE : after
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh, oh no, I didn't. 
Student_SCIENCE : no. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mm+hm. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : hey .., let me check ... let me check something here. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh, excellent, excellent. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, good
Student_SCIENCE : good job
Teacher_SCIENCE : mine needs to be ... 
Student_SCIENCE : why didn't you come up there when I asked your group to come up there, arthur? 
Student_SCIENCE : uh, because I waS't finished tracing it and measuring it and .. it. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I just need to do one thing to it first. 
Student_SCIENCE : ladies, how are we coming along? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, let me check your masses. 
Student_SCIENCE : mass, excellent. 
Student_SCIENCE : excellent, excellent, very good job
Teacher_SCIENCE : dude, that one thing ... this is .. zero. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : watch what happens. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : annabel. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm going to pass around some tape, what I want you to do is tape that on your paper, okay
Student_SCIENCE : as soon as I get the rest of the class situated, i'll pass out the tape. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it smells like muffins now. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : before it smelled like gingerbread and now it smells like muffins
Student_SCIENCE : bart. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and it tastes like glass. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : before it tasted like rubber ..
Student_SCIENCE : what are you doing, benny? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I'm, um, answering number two. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, then we need to answer number two and not talk to charlotte. 
Student_SCIENCE : all right. 
Student_SCIENCE : dude, your square doeS't even look like a square. 
Student_SCIENCE : that's not his. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. mine. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I cut the wrong one. 
Student_SCIENCE : has anything happened yet? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, you're done. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : good
Student_SCIENCE : it's hot. 
Student_SCIENCE : so you want to be careful, okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : can I fold it? 
Student_SCIENCE : hm? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : can I fold it? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, good. 
Student_SCIENCE : jim, no more. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : miss .., can I answer ..? 
Student_SCIENCE : absolutely. 
Student_SCIENCE : miss .., I can write ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : miss .., I was born to terrorize myself. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mm. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. those fractions. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : huh? 
Student_SCIENCE : get rid of the fractions. 
Student_SCIENCE : .. two grams, after. 
Student_SCIENCE : two grams. 
Student_SCIENCE : how big is yours? 
Student_SCIENCE : I don't know, let me measure. 
Student_SCIENCE : what's cedrick's? 
Student_SCIENCE : three point four grams. 
Student_SCIENCE : cedrick's is three point four grams? 
Student_SCIENCE : three point two grams. 
Student_SCIENCE : you mean centimeters. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : three point four ... I mean, centimeters. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. this one there? 
Student_SCIENCE : yes. 
Student_SCIENCE : this is yours
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, that's mine and that's my small one. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, yes, you need to put that on your paper
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : I have a question for you
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right. 
Student_SCIENCE : before heating you had point nine grams, after heating you had point six grams? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh+huh. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : hm. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what happened when you ... did some of the molecules go away
Student_SCIENCE : what happened to the molecules? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they reduced. 
Student_SCIENCE : they reduced? 
Student_SCIENCE : where did they go
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh, they melted? 
Student_SCIENCE : mm+hm, I don't know if they melted. 
Student_SCIENCE : disintegrated. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : disintegrated? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : the characteristics befor
Student_SCIENCE : waS't this thin before? 
Student_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's only a physical change, not a chemical change. 
Student_SCIENCE : and flexible? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, and now it's thick and not very flexible. 
Student_SCIENCE : it's not very flexible, but it's still thick. 
Student_SCIENCE : so do you still have the same amount of molecules in there
Teacher_SCIENCE : um, yes. 
Student_SCIENCE : yes. 
Student_SCIENCE : so what should these answers be
Teacher_SCIENCE : the same? 
Student_SCIENCE : bingo! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh no, miss ..? 
Student_SCIENCE : yes? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do we write the questions? 
Student_SCIENCE : what is going on gentlemen? 
Student_SCIENCE : benny, what going on
Teacher_SCIENCE : nothing. 
Student_SCIENCE : charlotte, question? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I haven't. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : do we write the questions? 
Student_SCIENCE : you never need to write the questions. 
Student_SCIENCE : you guys should know that
Teacher_SCIENCE : there's no room for it ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : right. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : if you're at your desk, you need to be working on the questions by yourself. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, I'm gonna go ahead and pass around some tape. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : to what? 
Student_SCIENCE : to your paper. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I knew that. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you knew that? 
Student_SCIENCE : gentlemen, follow my instructions. 
Student_SCIENCE : I've got, um, a few questions. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : .., this is very brittle. 
Student_SCIENCE : yes it is. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I broke it. 
Student_SCIENCE : it's not as flexible as it was before, was it? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so you can say, before, it was more flexible than afterwards? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's good
Teacher_SCIENCE : good, good, good
Student_SCIENCE : jason? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes? 
Student_SCIENCE : not this jason, that jason. 
Student_SCIENCE : watch for the tape, the tape is going up and down the aisles
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : because I know that there's probably a question here for number two. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : question one, it said "plus"...
Teacher_SCIENCE : why do you think it happened, explain what you saw inside the toaster oven. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : number two. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : your polymer should have had the same mass before and after heating
Teacher_SCIENCE : this is what we call a conservation of mass, because the root word is “to conserve”. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : some of you in here when I was walking around the room ... a lot of you hit this right on target, man, you got the same mass. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : good job! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : good job of measurement
Student_SCIENCE : some of you in here, however, didn't get the same mass and jason, jason, were you the one I had the conversation with? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : where ... where ... did the molecules go anywhere? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : did you still have the same amount of stuff ... that you had when you started
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah! 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so what did you just do to the mass, what did that mass look like at the beginning
Teacher_SCIENCE : what did your piece of plastic look like at the beginning, before you put it in the oven? 
Student_SCIENCE : bigger. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and thinner
Student_SCIENCE : it was maybe a lot bigger and thinner. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what happened to you after you heated it
Student_SCIENCE : it shrunk and got really thick and not as flexible. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, it just kinda shrunk, but it got thicker. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so you just kinda changed the volume, but the mass is still there
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : and put that in your own words. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : number three plus...
Teacher_SCIENCE : about the polymers and the polymer chains being arranged. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : how do you think they're arranged, and how do you think the arrangement of the chains influenced the behavior of the plastic container? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh, for example, prior to heating, your plastic looked one way, after heating the plastic looked another way. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what happened to the chains? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : were they parallel, were they crisscross, what happened to them
Student_SCIENCE : tape is coming around too, make sure that you tape your little piece of plastic on your paper. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. piece of plastic? 
Student_SCIENCE : what happened to your plastic? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's at Benny's. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : go get it. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : thank you. 
Student_SCIENCE : jason? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : is this yours? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, good. 
Student_SCIENCE : you need to tape that on there. 
Student_SCIENCE : with tape
Teacher_SCIENCE : tape it on? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : tape it on there. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : not tape it around, tape it on
Student_SCIENCE : stuart, you're totally done? 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, good
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. question ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, good. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : can we sit there? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : just make sure that your names are on both papers, if you have more than one. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : when you're done, I want you to think about what you want to add to your, um, cheat sheet over here. 
Student_SCIENCE : charlotte? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I didn't get this other question. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, it says "plus"
Teacher_SCIENCE : well, you know that we talked about polymer chains being arranged two different ways, remember that? 
Student_SCIENCE : parallel and crisscrossed, remember? 
Student_SCIENCE : how did the arrangement ... so how do you think the chains are arranged in a plastic
Teacher_SCIENCE : um, I think parallel, because you see the ... 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, then how do the arrangement of the chains influence the behavior of the plastic container? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : in other words the chains were arranged in a certain way based on what you said. 
Student_SCIENCE : when you heated it, how did that ... what did that to the plastic container? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mm+hm. 
Student_SCIENCE : I know. 
Student_SCIENCE : mm+hm. 
Student_SCIENCE : that's right
Student_SCIENCE : tell me, how do you know that
Student_SCIENCE : what did you observe happening in the toaster oven
Teacher_SCIENCE : it went up. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : mm, yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, guys, jim you have a question? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : no. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, bell is gonna be ringing in about two minutes. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : let me share with you before the bell rings what I want you to do with these papers
Teacher_SCIENCE : if they're not done, finish them for homework, I see you again tomorrow. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : because I have to tell you something at the end of the class period. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Student_SCIENCE : yes? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : .. for the last time? 
Student_SCIENCE : no, I didn't. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : that happened with escondido, huh, a boy in escondido? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah, no, I didn't see that
Teacher_SCIENCE : guys, quickly, quickly and quietly, I have a couple of things I need to share with you about what's gonna happen in class tomorrow. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : so while you're packing up, you guys can listen. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I think I mentioned to you at the beginning of class period today, that when you come into class tomorrow, you're going to take a test. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : you're going to take a science assessment test tomorrow. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : this is a test that, uh ... see the two boxes over there, the test is in the box. 
Student_SCIENCE : you guys remember like your sat nine test that you took last year? 
Student_SCIENCE : remember, you bubbled everything in
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and it's going to take us the entire class period. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : and come in and like I said you can leave your science notebooks at home because you're not gonna need them tomorrow. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh, let's see
Teacher_SCIENCE : I told you about your assignment
Teacher_SCIENCE : and we're going to go ahead and we're going to add it to the piece of paper over there, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, are they're any questions? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : questions? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : questions
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, let me double+check. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : let's see, actually, yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : no. 
Student_SCIENCE : the bell should have rung by now, or do we have one more minute
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's eleven forty eight. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : oh. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, we have one more minute
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay
Teacher_SCIENCE : all right, well then i'll ask you this
Teacher_SCIENCE : what can we add to this, real quick? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : does anybody in here want to put ... raise their hand up and tell me what I can add to the piece of paper? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what did you learn about polymers from this lab today? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : what did you learn that they can do
Teacher_SCIENCE : aha! 
Student_SCIENCE : what did you learn? 
Student_SCIENCE : dave
Teacher_SCIENCE : they can change. 
Student_SCIENCE : how can they change? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh, criss ... from parallel to crisscross. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they really can't change from a parallel to a crisscross, we'll talk about that, we'll talk about that next class period. 
Student_SCIENCE : uh, let's see, samantha? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : they could become smaller when you heat them. 
Student_SCIENCE : when you heat them what can we do to those long polymer chains? 
Student_SCIENCE : we can
Teacher_SCIENCE : shrink them. 
Student_SCIENCE : we can shrink them, yeah. 
Student_SCIENCE : so polymer chains can expand, and polymer chains can
Teacher_SCIENCE : but you know when they shrink, they get stronger? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes, they do. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : good and we'll talk about that also next class period
Student_SCIENCE : good. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : i'm just bringing this, okay? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : since I was such a good kid
Student_SCIENCE : and what are you gonna do with the balloon? 
Teacher_SCIENCE : I won't blow it up here in class, i'll wait till you're home. 
Student_SCIENCE : because if you blow the balloon and you get in trouble here at school. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : i'll be good. 
Student_SCIENCE : okay, you gotta promise. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : i'll ... I ... and even if I .., i'll say it waS't you. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh yeah. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : i'll say I found it on the ground. 
Student_SCIENCE : oh yeah, thanks. 
Teacher_SCIENCE : have a nice day. 
Student_SCIENCE : you too. Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, do I have any others of these pages?
Student_SCIENCE : here.
Teacher_SCIENCE : going once.
Student_SCIENCE : oh, I do.
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. That's it.
Student_SCIENCE : oh, wait, I need to write my name on it.
Teacher_SCIENCE : cool.
Student_SCIENCE : is my name on it?
Teacher_SCIENCE : it's fine.
Teacher_SCIENCE : I put your name on it.
Student_SCIENCE : oh.
Teacher_SCIENCE : guys, get out your binder reminders.
Student_SCIENCE : oh.
Student_SCIENCE : I didn't do it.
Teacher_SCIENCE : write down tonight's homework assignment.
Student_SCIENCE : are we going outside and do sunspots?
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah. that's the plan.
Teacher_SCIENCE : get what?
Student_SCIENCE : my binder reminder.
Teacher_SCIENCE : why? what did you leave it up there for?
Student_SCIENCE : because I just left it up there.
Teacher_SCIENCE : where is it? i'll send justin for it.
Student_SCIENCE : it's up there.
Teacher_SCIENCE : where?
Student_SCIENCE : I have to go get it.
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. there you go.
Teacher_SCIENCE : on page one forty nine, I'd like you to do questions one through four, please.
Student_SCIENCE : number eighteen?
Teacher_SCIENCE : questions one through four.
Teacher_SCIENCE : what do you need, miguel?
Student_SCIENCE : nothing.
Teacher_SCIENCE : cool.
Teacher_SCIENCE : but I can't remember whether we had some for today or whether we need to make some.
Student_SCIENCE : we need to make some.
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay.
Student_SCIENCE : we need another one for matt.
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay.
Teacher_SCIENCE : are you planning on doing some rude symbol while my back is turned?
Student_SCIENCE : no.
Teacher_SCIENCE : is that it?
Student_SCIENCE : no. because like if we do something then you're gonna see it then we're gonna get caught and get in trouble anyway.
Teacher_SCIENCE : I see.
Student_SCIENCE : I was just asking.
Teacher_SCIENCE : cindy, once it's washed off, you can sit down.
Student_SCIENCE : I need a towel.
Teacher_SCIENCE : I see. there's some next to the sink over there.
Teacher_SCIENCE : take two, and pass the rest back.
Student_SCIENCE : okay.
Teacher_SCIENCE : audrey, put that away or I'm gonna read it out loud to everybody.
Student_SCIENCE : okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Teacher_SCIENCE : on tape.
Student_SCIENCE : read it out loud.
Teacher_SCIENCE : thank you.
Student_SCIENCE : that'll be the most funniest moment.
Teacher_SCIENCE : then we can catch her reaction on tape, too.
Teacher_SCIENCE : fold it in half, turn.
Student_SCIENCE : that's all you had to do?
Teacher_SCIENCE : yeah.
Student_SCIENCE : where's randy?
Teacher_SCIENCE : he went to the nurse's office.
Student_SCIENCE : I forgot.
Teacher_SCIENCE : he wasn't feeling well.
Teacher_SCIENCE : which one of those is number one?
Student_SCIENCE : I got number two.
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, thanks.
Student_SCIENCE : can we do the other circle for the other paper too, mr. melville?
Teacher_SCIENCE : uh, yes.
Student_SCIENCE : mr. melville?
Teacher_SCIENCE : yes?
Student_SCIENCE : can we go out there when we're done, mr. melville?
Teacher_SCIENCE : well, we're all heading out there.
Teacher_SCIENCE : that's probably why you don't feel well, randy.
Student_SCIENCE : what happened to randy?
Teacher_SCIENCE : he's got a temperature of onehundred and two. so that's probably why he doesn't feel well.
Teacher_SCIENCE : come on, miguel.
Student_SCIENCE : okay.
Teacher_SCIENCE : any of these areas in the full sun is fine as long as you're not behind tree shadows.
Student_SCIENCE : right here.
Teacher_SCIENCE : that would be fine.
Student_SCIENCE : mr. melville, is this a sunspot; the big one right there?
Teacher_SCIENCE : i don't think so.
Student_SCIENCE : are you serious?
Teacher_SCIENCE : are you talking about this thing right there?
Student_SCIENCE : yeah.
Teacher_SCIENCE : I think that's just, uh, stuff on your mirror or your lens.
Teacher_SCIENCE : so you guys haven't done yours yet?
Student_SCIENCE : we just started.
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay. well, you're really close.
Teacher_SCIENCE : see these white spots here?
Student_SCIENCE : yeah.
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay, all I need is in the center of the target, see.
Student_SCIENCE : I didn't know that.
Teacher_SCIENCE : where's yours?
Student_SCIENCE : right there.
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay.
Teacher_SCIENCE : audrey, what are you doing going into other people's classrooms?
Student_SCIENCE : I'm not.
Teacher_SCIENCE : you're standing there with the door wide open. what are you doing?
Student_SCIENCE : because beatrice was talking to me and brenda.
Teacher_SCIENCE : stay away.
Teacher_SCIENCE : did you find one? you didn't get one moving west.
Student_SCIENCE : yes, I did.
Teacher_SCIENCE : no, you didn't.
Student_SCIENCE : what's west?
Teacher_SCIENCE : the direction that the sunspots move.
Student_SCIENCE : it was this one.
Teacher_SCIENCE : then how come there's not a series of marks?
Student_SCIENCE : because I didn't leave it there.
Teacher_SCIENCE : okay.Teacher_RME : Have a little discussion with the person next to you for a few moments.
Student_RME : (students discuss for several minutes)
Teacher_RME : So, we're trying to work out whether mum's right, or Isla's right. What do we think, who wants to come and try and convince the rest of us? Chris, do you want to try and convince us?
Student_RME : So, ten percent of fifty pounds is 5 pounds 60 because you divide it by 10. Because you want 20%, you have to times that by 2, which is 11 pounds 20, and then you have to add that on to the original price of 56 pounds equals 67 pounds 20 pents. So mum was right.
Teacher_RME : So mum was right. Who else thinks mum was right?
Student_RME : (student raises hand)
Teacher_RME : Okay. Mikey you also think mum was right. 
Student_RME : Yeah, there's a way that the girl could be right, cause she could've rounded that number to 70. 'Cause if you are rounding that means she would be right.
Student_RME : You could just go, I'll round it to make it 70. You could just be like, Oh, I think it's 70 but then when you pay for it... It could have been an estimate, if it was.
Teacher_RME : Whose was an estimate?
Student_RME : No, not the mum's 
Teacher_RME : So you think there's about 70 pounds.
Student_RME : Maybe because those prices on the stuff, so she's like, ah, they look like 70 pound.
Teacher_RME : Those look like 70-pound jeans.
Student_RME : Yeah.
Teacher_RME : Okay, so they might've estimated. 
Student_RME : I'm really confused.
Teacher_RME : You're really confused. Why are you confused about it?
Student_RME : Because it must be 20% of the original price taken off, so I don't know why you're adding 20% of that price onto it, because it would just be smaller.
Teacher_RME : So let's just pick what Abays just said. Why is he confused? Lorna. 
Student_RME : Because, it would have been 20% of the original price but Christian's done it where you add 20% to the end, the reduced price.
Teacher_RME : Oh.
Student_RME : You have to do that to do the original price. 
Teacher_RME : We have to find the original price. 
Student_RME : And that's how you do it. 
Teacher_RME : Well, as Christian's done it? 
Student_RME : There's different ways. 
Teacher_RME : Okay, who thinks they've got a different way then? Does anyone think that Eila was right?
Student_RME : Well it says it was this much, so you could always find out how much it was on the tag. 
Teacher_RME : Where does it say it was this much? 
Student_RME : Because, you know when you get discounts on things, it always says "was..."
Teacher_RME : So you're saying we might not actually have to work this out if we look at the price ticket. 
Teacher_RME : Okay, Nile, do you want to go up, then? Thank you, Christian.
Teacher_RME : And did you just underline that 20% off?
Student_RME : Yes.
Teacher_RME : Why?
Student_RME : Because it's off, it's off the original price.
Teacher_RME : Okay, well let's see, let's see. Let's see what Nile does and then we'll continue our discussion.
Student_RME : So we've said that 56 pounds that it's being reduced to, and because you're taking away 20%, so you get 80%, so you have to divide it, which would get you to 40%. And then divide it again which would get you to 20%, so 20% is 14, so you  just need to add those two together to get to 100%, which is 70, so it would be 70 pounds.
Teacher_RME : I'm confused, because it looks like on the board there's just a lot of numbers. I'm struggling to see this.
Student_RME : There's no, are you adding or timesing those numbers? There's no add or subtraction or timesing. 
Teacher_RME : Could anyone draw a picture to accompany what Nile's just done?
Student_RME : (student raises hand)
Teacher_RME : Do you want to draw a picture to accompoany what Nile's just done?
Student_RME : Cause it's easy...
Teacher_RME : Okay, let's just, I think we're starting to have a couple of little rumblings going on. 
Student_RME : So 100% has to be 70 pounds. The starting price, that's not the original price, 56 pounds is... No, 56 pounds is 80%, so we can't find 20% by dividing it by 5.
Student_RME : Yeah, because if we divide this by 5, which would be 20% if we're doing that way, that would be 16%, not actually 20%, 'cause this is that plus 80%.
Teacher_RME : Okay, lots of stuff there and I think some of us is still trying to process what's going on. 
Teacher_RME : Leo, can you see the picture that Stefan's drawn, and can you make sense of what he's done?
Student_RME : Umm...
Teacher_RME : Do you want to give us your interpretation?
Student_RME : Umm, so, he's found out 80% is 56 pounds.
Teacher_RME : Where's that come from, where's that information come from?
Student_RME : Because 20% they took of of 100%, and then, so 20% would be 14 pounds would be what they took from 70 which would make it 56 pounds, so that must mean that 20% is 14 pounds.
Teacher_RME : Okay. So we've got the 80%. How did we know it was 80%? Molly?
Student_RME : Because 20% of, 20% taken off was 80%?
Teacher_RME : Okay. So we've paid 80%. And what have we paid?
Teacher_RME : So what is this 20% and why are we trying to work that out? Christos?
Student_RME : Um...
Teacher_RME : Or how have we worked it out?
Student_RME : Um, well...it's kind of confusing. 
Teacher_RME : Do you want to try and ask a question that will help you be less confused?
Student_RME : Oh right, he's divided it by 4 to get 20%.
Teacher_RME : To get what?
Student_RME : Eighty.
Teacher_RME : Eighty, to get twenty. Why is he trying to find twenty?
Student_RME : Um, because... Oh, because he's trying to get to a hundred.
Teacher_RME : That's what's happening there? We're trying to get to a hundred? Really?
Student_RME : Yeah, because we need to find the full price but we've only got 80% and we need 20% to add on, so then because that equals a hundred, so then we'll be able to find the whole price.
Teacher_RME : Okay, so we're saying that Eila's correct. Are we all happy that Eila's correct? Why is mum not correct?
Student_RME : She's a mum.
Teacher_RME : She's a mum! She should be right! 
Student_RME : Mum's are never correct.
Teacher_RME : Mum's are never correct?! 
Student_RME : My mum isn't.
Teacher_RME : Azan?
Student_RME : Cause her mum found out 20% of the 20% off price, so she's just added 20% of the price that's been already have 20% taken off to the 20% price.
Teacher_RME : And what should she have done?
Student_RME : She should've divided the 80% by 4 to get 20% and then did that onto 56 pounds.
Teacher_RME : Mkay. 
Teacher_RME : I think this is a bit of a threshold concept to get your head around. It's tricky, yeah? Working out what we've got. What we've started with.
Teacher_RME : So, it says draw a bar labeled with the information Levis are 20% off and have a price of 56. So I think we've just done that as a class. We've just decided that altogether.
Teacher_RME : So when Eila was working it out she drew this bar, which was slightly different to Stefan's bar. So can you tell me what's the same, what's different?[You]:_GASLAWS : Our purpose is to investigate how gasses behave and what factors affect their behavior. So we're going to look at a scenario of this tank car. You have this tank train, and the interior of the tank car was washed out and cleaned with steam, and all the outlet valves were shut and the tank car was sealed. All the workers went home for the evening and when they returned in the morning this is what they found- I mean, do you know what they found?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Our purpose is to investigate how gasses behave and what factors affect their behavior. So we're going to look at a scenario of this tank car. You have this tank train, and the interior of the tank car was washed out and cleaned with steam, and all the outlet valves were shut and the tank car was sealed. All the workers went home for the evening and when they returned in the morning this is what they found- I mean, do you know what they found?
Student_GASLAWS : It exploded.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Maybe it exploded. Does anyone else have an idea of maybe what they found when they came back?
Student_GASLAWS : It decompressed.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What? Decompressed?
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah. You can see where the stress is at. Or maybe it froze.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so maybe we had a phase change, some stuff froze inside of it. So we have the idea that maybe it exploded, maybe it compressed, and maybe we see a- what?
Student_GASLAWS : Steam.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Did you say steam? Maybe you saw some steam coming off of it.
Student_GASLAWS : Because they were washing with steam.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So let's see what happened. Here's what they found when they came back.
Student_GASLAWS : Holy! Wow! Why'd that happen?
Teacher_GASLAWS : So that's what we're going to try to figure out. So I have a video of it actually happening, too.
Student_GASLAWS : That's crazy.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So here it is.
Student_GASLAWS : Whoa! That's crazy! Is it because there's nothing inside of it?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So, pretty crazy event here. I hear many of you asking how does it happen, and I've heard you saying some ideas, so what I want you to do, in the notes section of your journal, take a few minutes to brainstorm. What do you think is happening? What was happening inside or outside that made it crush? Why did it crush? How did it crush? If it helps you might want to think about before and after and maybe draw a picture of it. Maybe what was happening inside, outside, before, and then after.
Student_GASLAWS : There was no space for the moisture to go so it just exploded
Teacher_GASLAWS : So why would it go in?
Student_GASLAWS : What do you mean?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Because the tank went like, it went in.
Student_GASLAWS : Oh, yeah. Ok.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Good thought process here.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What do you think?
Student_GASLAWS : No idea.
Teacher_GASLAWS : No Idea? Well take a guess. What's happening inside of that tanker when they steam cleaned it?
Student_GASLAWS : No idea.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. Haha. So, is there anything inside there?
Student_GASLAWS : No.
Teacher_GASLAWS : No? Steam?
Student_GASLAWS : There's, like, ripples in there- I don't know, I don't know.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. You don't want to guess? You need to think about something- Try to take a guess. It doesn't have to be right at this point.
Student_GASLAWS : Alright.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What do you think's happening?
Student_GASLAWS : I think the air would be sucked out of it, I think that’s what was happening to it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : But it was sealed, right?
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah, it was sealed.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So when the steam turned back toliquid, what happened?
Student_GASLAWS : Everything was being sucked in.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So, What happens when steam turns into liquid? So when we think of our flask, that it was in, what was happening when the steam got- when the water vapor came off of it? Where did it go?
Student_GASLAWS : Into the balloon.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So it made that balloon expand. So what happened- how did we make the balloon unexpand?
Student_GASLAWS : We had to let it go. Like the pressure difference maybe.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. And what happens to the stuff, the water, the gas, what happens to it?
Student_GASLAWS : They turn back to water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so maybe that has something to do with it? How would that have something to do with it?
Teacher_GASLAWS : What's going on here?
Student_GASLAWS : For now we're just thinking about before it crunches and we're taking notes, or whatever.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. Good.
Student_GASLAWS : But the whole thing is, about the tornado, it looked like a mini tornado inside the tank that causes it to crash in an instant.
Teacher_GASLAWS : But what causes this mini tornado inside?
Student_GASLAWS : The steam, and then like, the air that we saw already in it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : So it made like a little mini tornado.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so you have steam inside, and what do you know about steam and its movement?
Student_GASLAWS : It's rapid.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Yes, the molecules are moving rapidly, and then there's already some air in there, ok, maybe, and then we know it's closed, a closed valve. And so why do you think then it would crush after that, if you get this movement of molecules inside and air inside?
Student_GASLAWS : Because it likes to move around. Like tornados, they start in one spot, and eventually they move to another one before they die out. So maybe it like, was running out of space inside the tank, it was trying to get out, and maybe it got unsealed and it was like "new air!".
Teacher_GASLAWS : Oh, well I think we can probably assume that the valve actually was sealed. Nothing was able to get in or out, it was a closed container. So let's go with that assumption, that there's not movement coming in and out of anything. So whatever's in here is in here. We need to think about how does the movement of the molecules inside end up, later, having that tanker crush. And one thing to think about is it was over night, so think about over night, what could have-
Student_GASLAWS : So we can add anything. Someone could have came and, you know…
Teacher_GASLAWS : No, we want to still stay with the assumption that it was sealed, so nobody touched it, it was just there. But what happens ove night?
Student_GASLAWS : Was it cold weather or like, hot weather?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Um, let's just imagine it's was a day like today.
Student_GASLAWS : Ok. So then the air probably cooled off a little bit, maybe.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So do you know how hot it was this morning when you got up?
Student_GASLAWS : Like fourty one degrees.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, and what is the high temperature for today?
Student_GASLAWS : I didn't watch the news.
Teacher_GASLAWS : It's supposed to get up to seventy today, so there is some temperature changes happening. Think about how maybe those temperature changes can affect what's happening in here.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So let's start with the beginning here, what's happening?
Student_GASLAWS : Um, in the beginning steam expanded and the high pressure was-
Teacher_GASLAWS : So what's this high pressure? Where is the high pressure?
Student_GASLAWS : You know how the experiement you did, when you put in the hot water and the balloon kind of blew up from all the steam?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so can you show me that in this picture? What is the pressure doing?
Student_GASLAWS : It's pushing out.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so let's illustrate that. It's pushing- so how is it pushing? Like, what's going on with those-
Student_GASLAWS : It's expanding, it's gettinng hot, it's got nowhere else to go.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : It's trying to escape.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So you might want to add that to your diagram. So you have pressure against the container wall, because why?
Student_GASLAWS : Because the gas is expanding. Because it's hot.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so then what happens- oh, so it's taking up more space- and then what do you see, what's happening in the middle here?
Student_GASLAWS : It's starting to go back to water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : It's not taking up as much space.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So you have some liquid here. And maybe, you know how you indicate some pressure here, maybe you can show that here. And what are these arrows?
Student_GASLAWS : That's the pressure making contractions.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What pressure? The pressure of what?
Student_GASLAWS : Of the steam. Because it's- it has to contract because there's not enough heat.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so it's putting less pressure aginast the walls of the container?
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Teacher_GASLAWS : But how does that make the container end up like this? How does it crush?
Student_GASLAWS : Because it's the pressure on the outside is stronger than on the inside.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Oh, ok. Interesting idea. So there's pressure in the air, and now somehow that is now less than this?
Student_GASLAWS : More.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Oh more than this, oh right. So maybe you can show that in this picture then.
Teacher_GASLAWS : This looks empty now. Is it empty?
Student_GASLAWS : Well, I mean, maybe it has regular air in it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Because this is before, they steam cleaned it, and so then they closed all the vales, and nothing could get in or out, so there still has to be something in there. What would be in here?
Student_GASLAWS : Just, some air. Regular air.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What happened to the steam?
Student_GASLAWS : It went out when it exploded. I mean imploded. Because it broke really quick and there's holes all over it. So the steam got out.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So let's assume that it didn't break, that it just crushed.
Student_GASLAWS : So then the steam is still there.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So the steam is still there, so how can you explain what happened?
Student_GASLAWS : Maybe it turned into liquid.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Why would it turn into liquid?
Student_GASLAWS : You said something about that, right?
Teacher_GASLAWS : So, it went back to liquid, so how can you show that in your picture?
Student_GASLAWS : We could just draw some water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : And then I want you to think about why would, what's going on here, and it turns into liquid, why would it cause this crushing? Why would it crush in?
Student_GASLAWS : Because we learned about the heat, that it expands, so if it's cold- I don't know why I think it's cold. The heat could get out.
Teacher_GASLAWS : It can't come out, it's sealed.
Student_GASLAWS : I guess it went in reverse. Instead of first liquid and then gas, I guess it just reversed
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so you need to think about what would cause this to implode.
Student_GASLAWS : If for some reason the molecules are getting smaller or changing size.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So what do they do?
Student_GASLAWS : They're pulling in the sides of the tank.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Like, remember if I have some steam and I have some water, which takes up more space?
Student_GASLAWS : The water- no, the steam.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so think about that. You have steam here, you said it's going all quickly, what is that doing to the outside of the container?
Student_GASLAWS : What do you mean?
Teacher_GASLAWS : The molecules that are moving in here, how are they-
Student_GASLAWS : They're putting pressure.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So they're putting pressure against the container here?
Student_GASLAWS : There's a lot of pressure in the container.
Teacher_GASLAWS : You might want to draw- show me how you would show pressure inside of the container. And then think about what causes this to shrink in. Ok? Think about that.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So what do you mean by gravity?
Student_GASLAWS : Gravity. Like air pressing down on the tank.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so there's air pressing down on the tank. Is that only on the top, you think?
Student_GASLAWS : Well, it- we just think that there's more air on the top pushing down than in the bottom there's not a lot of air in the bottom.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so there's air pushing on the tank here.
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Teacher_GASLAWS : And then, tell me what's going on in this picture now.
Student_GASLAWS : Um, it's starting to kinda get pushed in.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so what's causing that pushing?
Student_GASLAWS : Um, pressure on the tank, and maybe like the metal got a little weakned by the steam being so heated so that maybe made it more easier to press down.
Teacher_GASLAWS : For now let's assume that nothing could get in or out. So nothing can come out. What's happening inside to make it take up less space?
Student_GASLAWS : The molecules are breaking other molecules because they need some space because there's not much room inside.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, and then I want you to continue thinking about that and then think about that they went home and came back the next day, so think about what could have happened over night that could also affect what's inside
Student_GASLAWS : The molecules became like, this molecule went into this one and became bigger.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so maybe molecules combine and that's why they're taking up less space.
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Um, so, but remember if molecules combine they become something else. So do you think what was inside the tanker changed?
Student_GASLAWS : Not really because they were just inside the tank.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so think about what happened over night that when they came back, they saw this. But I like seeing some of these things here, that's good. Keep it up, you're doing a good job.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So what do you mean by "suck all the air"?
Student_GASLAWS : Like, you know, we had a little air in the tank, right here.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Where's the air?
Student_GASLAWS : Inside.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Inside? Is there air outside, too?
Student_GASLAWS : Gravity. Like, all the molecules sucked all the air in which made the molecules bigger.
Teacher_GASLAWS : How could air get in here?
Student_GASLAWS : Air molecules.
Teacher_GASLAWS : But remember we said it was a sealed container, so nothing can get in or out.
Student_GASLAWS : That's what I'm saying, the air inside.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Oh, so the air inside is getting- it's sucking somehow?
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Teacher_GASLAWS : But what does that have to do with what you are calling gravity out here? The pressure.
Student_GASLAWS : It pushes down.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So that's still pushing here. I don't see it here. Um, but what's happening inside?
Student_GASLAWS : Um, the molecules are not moving as rapidly as they were at first.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So how does that allow it to cause it to crush?
Student_GASLAWS : There's more pressure.
Teacher_GASLAWS : No more pressure? Pressure where?
Student_GASLAWS : On the tank. All over the tank.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : All the molecules were moving around. And so there's no more pressure.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So can one of you write a note of that for yourself, so when you're presenting you remember to say that part?
Teacher_GASLAWS : And we can have phase changes, and also there's liquids and gasses, and we also know that temperature affects it. So if we go over night, what you guys were already talking about, it can get colder.
Student_GASLAWS : Isn't it hard for gas to be contained?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Uh huh.
Student_GASLAWS : There it is. The gas, like, didn’t want to be in there. The molecules pushed outwards somehow…
Teacher_GASLAWS : So maybe they're pushing out here. So why don't you show that?
Student_GASLAWS : …the molecules bumped into each other too much so they went faster, pushing out more.
Teacher_GASLAWS : But that would cause an explosion. Right? And we're thinking of implosion.
Student_GASLAWS : But only the middle collapsed, and the sides didn't really collapse.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so only the middle collapsed. So if you have like a water bottle or something, how do you get it to collapse?
Student_GASLAWS : Easy.
Teacher_GASLAWS : How?
Student_GASLAWS : You just, like, take all the air out of it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. Or how else could you get it to collapse? I have a can in front of me, what can I do to make it crush?
Student_GASLAWS : Stomp on it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Yeah, you stomp on it. So what are you doing when you stomp on it?
Student_GASLAWS : Hulk angry!
Teacher_GASLAWS : So, maybe there's something going on outside that's making it get smaller.
Student_GASLAWS : Maybe there's an invisible foot, that like, basically stomped on it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so let's take all these ideas. You told me you have molecules moving around, you also told me they're expanding and they're putting pressuring along the outside of the tank. So maybe you could draw some of those things. Something to show me that it's putting pressure against the walls of the container.
Teacher_GASLAWS : It was 70 degrees in the middle of the day, and then maybe 30 degrees overnight. How could that affect what's going on inside?
Student_GASLAWS : By the weather changing the molecules, like, I dunno, like, maybe the steam cooled down.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so if the steam cooled down what would happen to it?
Student_GASLAWS : It wouldn't move as fast. It would slow down and maybe go back into liquid form.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so maybe if that happened in there, how is that different than what you showed me?
Student_GASLAWS : Because it got water in it now.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, why don't you draw that. So why would water in the bottom of this tank make it-
Student_GASLAWS : So you know how steam is, when you have steam, something like, it turns into a little liquid. So I think all those air molecules, after they exploded, they turned into liquid at the bottom.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so we have the liquid here at the bottom. And so, how is the liquid here on the bottom different from the liquid you showed me here?
Student_GASLAWS : Because the molecules are moving slower.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : It's a different phase.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. And so how could that allow the can to get crushed? Take a guess here.
Student_GASLAWS : So, like, I'm going to take a funny guess, the molecules, they like, transformed into a molecule foot.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : And it was so big and so powerful because of the steam and stuff, and it just stompled, and all the pressure just-
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so let's take this imaginary foot and I stomp it on here, and now I try to stomp it on the one with water in it, which one would crush more?
Student_GASLAWS : The one with water in it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Why?
Student_GASLAWS : Because the water's not moving outward, it's not moving as fast, it's not trying to really get out. It's just there.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so I think that's a pretty good explanation, but let's imagine what this imaginary big stomping foot is. What is this foot?
Student_GASLAWS : Air.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So it's air.
Student_GASLAWS : It's air.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So show me that here. And show me that here. And you'll be ready to present.Teacher_GASLAWS : Let's get started. As I walked around I saw a lot of you had some new ideas about pressure, a lot of you talked about pressure. And a lot of you were talking about air. Some of you said you learned some new things about temperature, and compression, and the molecules. And so, before we continue today, we're going to continue gathering information, trying to figure out how this tanker crushed. But before we do that I would like to look back over your posters from yesterday. So we going to look at the posters and make a list of what is causing the tanker to crush based on your ideas. And also, I want us to start looking, does anything seem to be linked together? so does one thing happening in the tanker seem to cause another thing to happen. So as we look through this, that's what we'll be looking for. So with this group, they showed us here the molecules moving around. So I think this one did a really good job of showing us those molecules moving inside the tanker. And then they said, as it cooled down, what happened to the molecules?
Student_GASLAWS : Slower.
Teacher_GASLAWS : They became slower. And she- they showed us that those molecules slowed down. They also showed us some air outside of the tanker. And they show us then, what happens then to the air molecules? In this one right here?
Student_GASLAWS : They stopped.
Teacher_GASLAWS : They, well, maybe they stopped. You're right, they're not showing us that they're moving at all, but we know that molecules don't ever stop moving until they get to absolute zero. But they're moving more slowly, and they're compressed. Okay, so they're really thinking about how temperature is affecting the molecules inside the tanker. Um, let's see, this one and this one. Took that a little bit further and talked about how temperature affected that gas. And, can you see what they're showing here? What happens to the gas when it got cooler? What do we see forming here?
Student_GASLAWS : It changed to a liquid.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Yeah, so it's actually having a phase change. We're getting liquid water collecting at the bottom of the tanker. Look, they're showing us here, are there any more gas- water particles in this picture? They said it all turned to liquid. So they had this idea that it started all as a gas, and then it started to, um, condense and become liquid, and eventually it all became liquid. And this group started to think about this too. Started to think about this, um, this orange is showing that it was a gas, and then it didn't dry up, but they talked about this being water at the bottom of the tanker. And then, some groups started to think about pressure, and the molecules moving around. So this group shows the molecules moving. Here they're showing arrows. And they're showing these arrows going out, showing that there's collisions going against the edge here, of the tanker. So they're thinking about the pressure that's being created by the molecules moving around here and then they said that as it gets colder they're slowing down, so again they're talking about the speed of the molecules. And they're talking about pressure here too. And they're also trying to think about these air molecules outside the tanker. So they have little drawings of air molecules here, and they're showing arrows of that air pushing against the tanker. They're thinking that that air is just pushing down on the top. So that's something we can think about. And then, this group also talked about pressure. This is the one where they said, they kind of imagined the that this air around the tanker is like a giant foot pushing down on it, on the tank. Can this group remind us why the air foot able to crush this one and not this one?
Student_GASLAWS : Because the first one had gas in it, the gas was creating pressure up against the wall of the tank, and if it was turned into water the tank probably wasn't having as much pressure on the sides of it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : So it was probably easier for it to crush.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So, something about a difference between what was inside here versus here which allowed that pressure outside to have different affects between this one and this one. And I think that this group also showed us that, they said the pressure inside became less than the pressure outside, so it allowed it to crush. So we have all these ideas that we're working on, and so, we have some idea of temperature. What did temperature, tell someone next to you, what did temperature seem to affect inside the tanker? Tell someone next to you. What did the temperature seem to affect? Ok, so what did it seem to affect?
Student_GASLAWS : The molecules.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What about the molecules inside? Ok, so temperature affected the molecules. What about the molecules?
Student_GASLAWS : They got slower.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so it affected speed and phase. And we also talked about some pressure here. Pressure inside the can, or the tanker, and pressure outside. So the pressure inside, what does that link to? Tell someone next to you, what does pressure inside, how is that affected or what caused pressure inside of the can to change? Tell somebodynext to you. What caused the pressure inside of the can to change? So something about the pressure inside, which groups showed us the pressure of the molecules inside the can having and affect, or inside the taker having an affect?
Student_GASLAWS : That one.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Which one? This one? Ok, what did they say about what caused this pressure against the walls of the- Vernon? What caused the pressure here?
Student_GASLAWS : Uh, the steam.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So something about the steam and, so, the pressure inside caused by what?
Student_GASLAWS : The steam.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Caused by the steam?
Student_GASLAWS : It kept the shape.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. Because gasses take the shape of the container. Ok, so I want you to keep thinking about this. What's causing that pressure inside? And how about the pressure outside? What did the pressure outside have to do with this scenario? Who showed something about pressure outside having an affect?
Student_GASLAWS : Justin's group. The pink paper.
Teacher_GASLAWS : This one talked about, you talked about. The pink paper did show air outside, and so did- did this group? Did you guys talk about air out here? And I think there's one more. This air foot was kind of an idea of pressure outside. So what does the pressure outside do to the tanker, based on what some of your groups have talked about?
Student_GASLAWS : Compression.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so it crushes the tanker. And I want you to continue thinking about this. Why would it crush the tanker? Why does it have the ability to crush it? Because it's not getting crushed here, and it's not getting crushed here, right? So we're going to continue adding to our list here as we continue today.
Teacher_GASLAWS : And you have tongs to touch the cans, so don't touch the can with your fingers. You're going to put it on the hotplate and turn it on and wait until it starts to boil. You'll see steam coming out and you'll hear it boiling. And let it boil for about a minute. Then, you're going to wear your goggles the whole time. You're going to take your tongs, pick up your can, and you're going to flip it over with the top part into the plastic. Ok? So what do you think is going to happen?
Student_GASLAWS : I think it's going to air, the air-
Teacher_GASLAWS : Tell someone next to you.
Student_GASLAWS : It's going to do like the tanker do.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So what do you think is going to happen?
Student_GASLAWS : It's going to crush.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so I hear some people saying it's going to crush or impload. Why would it do that?
Student_GASLAWS : [silence]
Teacher_GASLAWS : What? You can't tell? You don't know what will happen?
Student_GASLAWS : I know it's going to crush.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, you know it's going to crush. You've seen it before. We don't know why. We're changing the temperature. We're boiling it and then we're putting it in cold water.
Student_GASLAWS : Oh! I think it might make it, like, make the molecules squishing together.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Tani asked a good question. She said are we going to seal the top of the container. So, when we take this can and we flip it over, what are we doing to the top of the container here?
Student_GASLAWS : Sealing it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : You're going to be covering it. So you're going to keep thinking about that. And I'm not going to show you what's going to happen. I want you to do it yourself. Ok?
Student_GASLAWS : It's going to cause a reaction.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What kind of reaction?
Student_GASLAWS : Um, cold and hot together, which means it will… impload I guess.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : It has no air, so...
Teacher_GASLAWS : What has no air?
Student_GASLAWS : This.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What do you mean it has no air?
Student_GASLAWS : It can't get in.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so air can't get in. So how does that affect it, you think?
Student_GASLAWS : Well, just like our theory. They're just trying to get in there.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so, alright, so you have your can, it's flipped over, and, what do you mean by air is trying to get in?
Student_GASLAWS : Well, since it's cold, the water- the temperature of the water causes it to be cold, and- I don't know, actually.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so I want you to keep thinking about that. Think about that air, and you're describing it as it wants to get in, but I want you to think about what is that air doing on the outside of the can.
Student_GASLAWS : Ok.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So you can start by doing number one, you can start by drawing the pop can, and you can start by drawing that stage one, the pop can, when there's fifteen milliliters of water in it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What happened?
Student_GASLAWS : It sucked it in.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Oh.
Student_GASLAWS : The water went schloop.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so let's talk about what just happned here. You have your first can here, and so, you should be showing me what's in the can, and draw the molecules of gas inside the can. So, I see in Tani's picture, she has some water in the bottom. Is there any- what else is in this can?
Student_GASLAWS : Pop. A little bit.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so maybe there's a little bit of pop. And what else is in there?
Student_GASLAWS : Air.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Yeah, so there's air in the can, too. And now I see that you have it on the hot plate here, what happens as you're heating it up?
Student_GASLAWS : Steam.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Steam's coming out. And what- So, can you show me, um- draw the molecules of gas that's inside the can. Show me what they're doing. Use the arrows to show the movement of the molecules inside. So now, these, to me, look like they're just sitting there. Are they moving?
Student_GASLAWS : No.
Teacher_GASLAWS : They're not moving?
Student_GASLAWS : What's moving? The little molecules?
Teacher_GASLAWS : How can I tell by looking at this that they're moving?
Student_GASLAWS : Oh. Haha.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Why would water go into the can you think?
Student_GASLAWS : Because the pressure went schloop. The pressure sucked it in. The cold air sucked it in. Negative pressure.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What do you mean by that?
Student_GASLAWS : The pressure's not pushing it out, it's sucking it in because it's negative.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So, how could you also explain negative pressure, thinking about comparing two pressures? Because that might help you think about what's happening on theoutside of the can too. So think about comparing pressures.
Student_GASLAWS : We should do this one.
Teacher_GASLAWS : You can. You can do that one as you work on the next ones. I want you to think about, especially, I heard you start to think of some ideas. I want you to think about the can crushing and what do you wonder about how you can change the experiment. Like, what do you think might affect how much the can crushes? Or what do you think might affect the temperature of the gas?
Teacher_GASLAWS : So you think you can maybe change the temperature of this, and then how much water you can put inside the can? Ok, so, and then you're going to be- I see, you already started here. So you think the water might affect- What are you thinking about the water? The amount of water?
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So the amount of water might affect the can because?
Student_GASLAWS : We haven't gotten that far.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. Haha. So what do you think? How could changing the amount of water inside the can affect it?
Student_GASLAWS : It's possible that it would crush it more, or less.
Teacher_GASLAWS : If you did what?
Student_GASLAWS : If you add different amount of water to it.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so let's take one example. We put less water inside of it, what do you think might happen?
Student_GASLAWS : Probably wouldn't crush as much.
Teacher_GASLAWS : As much what?
Student_GASLAWS : Because there's less pressure inside of it, there's less pressure change.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : There's less steam because there's less water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so maybe if there's less steam, it would crush less. And then what if you put less water in here?
Student_GASLAWS : I don't think it would crush as much if you put a lot of water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Why?
Student_GASLAWS : Because it would have- I don't know, I just don't think it would.
Teacher_GASLAWS : I think you have a good idea. Why do you think it might not?
Student_GASLAWS : Because there's too much pressure on the inside. Too much water for it to do that. Because I know if you squish something it pushes up.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So something about the water might be too much-
Student_GASLAWS : It would be too full.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so it takes up too much space. Ok. So those are the kinds of questions, er statements I want you to make here. So you can say, I think the amount of water might affect the can pressure because- and explain why.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Can you think of anything else we could change about what we did here, that might affect the cans?
Student_GASLAWS : Colder water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Colder water? Where?
Student_GASLAWS : In the bucket.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So, I'm not sure if we could make this much colder, but what if we made it, just, without ice? What do you think would happen then?
Student_GASLAWS : It wouldn't crush as much.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Why not?
Student_GASLAWS : Because it's not really cold. This has to be really hot, this has to be really cold, when they touch each other they try to communicate with each other, but they can't, so it's like a negative.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So let's think about- I heard two things here. I heard one, about the temperature of the can, how hot to make that, and I also heard about the temperature of that. So you could do two things. You think that the- I think that the temperature of the water, the ice, the water bath could affect how much the can crushed because- and then tell me why you think that. And then also, you said something about the temperature inside the can. So maybe, I think that the temperature inside the can, or maybe how long it boils, would affect it because- So that's what you're going to write.
Student_GASLAWS : So, what would happen right there, would it affect, like, a plastic bottle?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Oh, so also, ok, so maybe-
Student_GASLAWS : Like, does it have to be metal or aluminum?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Great question. So go ahead and write that question here. Or here. So here's your questions, here your going to actually try to think about why your questions, like, how it might affect it. So you might say, does the kind of material affect it? And here you would say, I think the material does affect it because- and explain why.
Student_GASLAWS : Ok.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so tell me more about that, the how much space the water takes up part.
Student_GASLAWS : Um, I know if we put like, a lot of water, it's not going to crush as much. Because we measured that can to that can, and we put 15 in this one, and put 40 in that one.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Oh, you put more in that one. Ok. So you already did a little experiment.
Student_GASLAWS : which one was- This one was more than that one.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So, you've already had- you've already done it and you see a difference. So what are your ideas about why that one didn't crush as much?
Student_GASLAWS : Because we put more water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so you know- You kinda see that the amount of water affected it.
Student_GASLAWS : Uh huh.
Teacher_GASLAWS : And could you say that there's maybe two things going on, what and what?
Student_GASLAWS : Pressure and space.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Pressure difference and space. So, there's more water in here, what does that do to the space?
Student_GASLAWS : There's less space for it to implode.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Oh, so the water is already taking up space for the implosion. And you also think that that water has something to do with the difference in pressure.
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So think about, in your reading last night, you read something about the behavior of gasses and, um, there compression. So you want to continue thinking about that, like, compression of gas versus how much you compressed water. Think about how that might affect your results.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. And so it says make sure to draw the molecules of gas inside the can, use arrows to show the movement of the molecules. So this is the beginning one, and this one's on the hot plate?
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So where- Is there any gas in this can right now?
Student_GASLAWS : Um, not really. No. The liquid's just- It's just liquid right now. It's at the bottom. It's not being heated.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So what's in this space of the can?
Student_GASLAWS : Some air.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Air? What is air?
Student_GASLAWS : [silence]
Teacher_GASLAWS : Is air a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
Student_GASLAWS : Uh, a gas.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So we have water and we have, like, oxygen, or our air molecules that should be in this part your can. So how could you draw those in there?
Student_GASLAWS : Um, like circles, or?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Yeah. Little- just like circles or particles.
Student_GASLAWS : The particles can be air?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Mhmm. But I want you to continue thinking of what's happening now when it's being heated up. What's happening inside the can, ok?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Hey, so I heard you guys are debating about whether or not this was sealed or not sealed. So tell me more about that.
Student_GASLAWS : Oh, we decided it's sealed.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so why is it- How do you know it's sealed?
Student_GASLAWS : Because we put it like that, with the top down.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so you put it with the top down.
Student_GASLAWS : Mhmm.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So tell me why did this happen?
Student_GASLAWS : We're still deciding on that.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. You might want to pick up this can to see what happened.
Student_GASLAWS : Pick it up?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Yeah, pick it up. And kind of dump it out. Do you think the amount of water inside that can changed?
Student_GASLAWS : As it boiled or as it-
Teacher_GASLAWS : No. When you flipped it up, like right now, was there more water it in?
Student_GASLAWS : No.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So it didn't change much.
Student_GASLAWS : Maybe. Because if it was in there, water would flow in.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Why would it flow in?
Student_GASLAWS : Because it's open.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So you can maybe think about that, but let's think about why this crushed. Because I see a picture here, I see all sorts of movement of molecules.
Student_GASLAWS : That's weird though.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What's weird?
Student_GASLAWS : How did the air get out? How does it crush if the air didn't get out?
Teacher_GASLAWS : So what's inside the can in your picture right here?
Student_GASLAWS : There's air and water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Air and water? Ok, so then when you flipped it over what happened?
Student_GASLAWS : Oh, wait. I didn't take all the air out though. There's still air and water in there.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so there's air and water still in here. What happened to it?
Student_GASLAWS : [Silence]
Teacher_GASLAWS : What do you think?
Student_GASLAWS : [Silence]
Teacher_GASLAWS : Did you take anything out of the can when you flipped it over?
Student_GASLAWS : No.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so what happened to the stuff inside there?
Student_GASLAWS : It got- The water started coming down. The hot water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so- What?
Student_GASLAWS : The boiling water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : The boiling water went-
Student_GASLAWS : It come out as you were putting it in. It was coming out.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so the hot water was down here, you flipped it over, and now it's down here.
Student_GASLAWS : Mhmm.
Teacher_GASLAWS : What else happened?
Student_GASLAWS : The can crushed. The water inside the can was released.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So maybe some of the water came out. Is the water- and what else do you think happned?
Student_GASLAWS : The cold water and the hot water touuched.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. And-
Student_GASLAWS : The reaction thing.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So, when cold water and hot water touch each other, what happens to it?
Student_GASLAWS : It spins- it like, creates a tornado.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Hmm. How could that affect- how could that make the can crush?
Student_GASLAWS : [silence]
Teacher_GASLAWS : I want you to think about these gas molecules. You have these gas molecules moving around inside of there.
Student_GASLAWS : Mhmm.
Teacher_GASLAWS : And they're moving all over, I see some big arrows. And then you flipped your can over. What do you think happned to those?
Student_GASLAWS : What happened to it?
Teacher_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Student_GASLAWS : Um, they're still in there.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Oh, so maybe they could have turned into liquid a little bit?
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Why would they have turned into liquid?
Student_GASLAWS : The steam got cold.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so they got cold and then maybe they condensed into liquid?
Student_GASLAWS : Oh, I see.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So, how would that make it crush then?
Student_GASLAWS : Uh, because there's less- because there's no air no more. Causing it to turn into water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : It's confusing.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Yeah, it is confusing. But you can keep working through that. You guys have lots of good ideas, so keep trying to work through it together.
Teacher_GASLAWS : So, you can do why the can is crushing too, but I want you to start thinking about what do you wonder about this, like, what parts of the experiment could you change? Is there anything that you think, like, might affect the can or make it crush more or less?
Student_GASLAWS : The amount of water in the can.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. How could that affect it?
Student_GASLAWS : Because we only put 15 milliliters, so it would probably crush more if we put more water.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Why?
Student_GASLAWS : More steam.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So why do you think more steam would make it crush more?
Student_GASLAWS : Because, it also causes it to have less air inside the can.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : So less air, the more space.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. What do you think about that? If we put more water in the can would it crush more or less?
Student_GASLAWS : I think it would be less.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Why?
Student_GASLAWS : There would be, like, less steam.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok.
Student_GASLAWS : Because it's kind of small, so there wouldn't be that much steam.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok, so if you put more water in here, you're saying that it would change actually how much space was available for that steam to take up.
Student_GASLAWS : Yeah.
Teacher_GASLAWS : Ok. So that's the kind of thing you're going to write here. You're going to say, I think the amount of water might affect how much the can crushes because, and say why. So your idea is that it would have more or less space for the steam to take up. So that's what you're going to write in this space.
